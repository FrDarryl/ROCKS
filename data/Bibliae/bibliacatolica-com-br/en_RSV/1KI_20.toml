"1" = ''':sup:`1` Ben-ha'dad the king of Syria gathered all his army together;
thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots; and he went up
and besieged Sama'ria, and fought against it.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, and
said to him, "Thus says Ben-ha'dad:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` `Your silver and your gold are mine; your fairest wives and children
also are mine.'"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And the king of Israel answered, "As you say, my lord, O king, I am
yours, and all that I have."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The messengers came again, and said, "Thus says Ben-ha'dad: `I sent
to you, saying, "Deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives
and your children";
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this
time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants,
and lay hands on whatever pleases them, and take it away.'"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said,
"Mark, now, and see how this man is seeking trouble; for he sent to me
for my wives and my children, and for my silver and my gold, and I did
not refuse him."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And all the elders and all the people said to him, "Do not heed or
consent."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So he said to the messengers of Ben-ha'dad, "Tell my lord the king,
`All that you first demanded of your servant I will do; but this thing
I cannot do.'" And the messengers departed and brought him word again.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Ben-ha'dad sent to him and said, "The gods do so to me, and more
also, if the dust of Sama'ria shall suffice for handfuls for all the
people who follow me."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the king of Israel answered, "Tell him, `Let not him that girds
on his armor boast himself as he that puts it off.'"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When Ben-ha'dad heard this message as he was drinking with the
kings in the booths, he said to his men, "Take your positions." And
they took their positions against the city.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said,
"Thus says the LORD, Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I
will give it into your hand this day; and you shall know that I am the
LORD."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Ahab said, "By whom?" He said, "Thus says the LORD, By the
servants of the governors of the districts." Then he said, "Who shall
begin the battle?" He answered, "You."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then he mustered the servants of the governors of the districts,
and they were two hundred and thirty-two; and after them he mustered
all the people of Israel, seven thousand.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And they went out at noon, while Ben-ha'dad was drinking himself
drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings who helped him.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The servants of the governors of the districts went out first. And
Ben-ha'dad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, "Men are coming
out from Sama'ria."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if
they have come out for war, take them alive."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So these went out of the city, the servants of the governors of the
districts, and the army which followed them.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And each killed his man; the Syrians fled and Israel pursued them,
but Ben-ha'dad king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the king of Israel went out, and captured the horses and
chariots, and killed the Syrians with a great slaughter.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel, and said to him,
"Come, strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do; for
in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, "Their gods are
gods of the hills, and so they were stronger than we; but let us fight
against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And do this: remove the kings, each from his post, and put
commanders in their places;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for
horse, and chariot for chariot; then we will fight against them in the
plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they." And he hearkened to
their voice, and did so.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` In the spring Ben-ha'dad mustered the Syrians, and went up to
Aphek, to fight against Israel.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And the people of Israel were mustered, and were provisioned, and
went against them; the people of Israel encamped before them like two
little flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the country.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And a man of God came near and said to the king of Israel, "Thus
says the LORD, `Because the Syrians have said, "The LORD is a god of
the hills but he is not a god of the valleys," therefore I will give
all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am
the LORD.'"
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And they encamped opposite one another seven days. Then on the
seventh day the battle was joined; and the people of Israel smote of
the Syrians a hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And the rest fled into the city of Aphek; and the wall fell upon
twenty-seven thousand men that were left. Ben-ha'dad also fled, and
entered an inner chamber in the city.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And his servants said to him, "Behold now, we have heard that the
kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us put sackcloth
on our loins and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of
Israel; perhaps he will spare your life."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their
heads, and went to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant
Ben-ha'dad says, `Pray, let me live.'" And he said, "Does he still
live? He is my brother."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Now the men were watching for an omen, and they quickly took it up
from him and said, "Yes, your brother Ben-ha'dad." Then he said, "Go
and bring him." Then Ben-ha'dad came forth to him; and he caused him to
come up into the chariot.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And Ben-ha'dad said to him, "The cities which my father took from
your father I will restore; and you may establish bazaars for yourself
in Damascus, as my father did in Sama'ria." And Ahab said, "I will let
you go on these terms." So he made a covenant with him and let him go.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow at
the command of the LORD, "Strike me, I pray." But the man refused to
strike him.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then he said to him, "Because you have not obeyed the voice of the
LORD, behold, as soon as you have gone from me, a lion shall kill you."
And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion met him and killed him.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Then he found another man, and said, "Strike me, I pray." And the
man struck him, smiting and wounding him.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And as the king passed, he cried to the king and said, "Your
servant went out into the midst of the battle; and behold, a soldier
turned and brought a man to me, and said, `Keep this man; if by any
means he be missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall
pay a talent of silver.'
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone." The king
of Israel said to him, "So shall your judgment be; you yourself have
decided it."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then he made haste to take the bandage away from his eyes; and the
king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And he said to him, "Thus says the LORD, `Because you have let go
out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore
your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.'"
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And the king of Israel went to his house resentful and sullen, and
came to Sama'ria.

Notas de rodap√©:
20:1-4 - Ben-Hadad, king of Syria, gathers his allies to attack Israel.
Ben-Hadad's demand for surrender from Ahab demonstrates the enemy's
arrogance and Israel's fragility at that moment. This narrative
highlights how God uses even oppressive situations to reveal His power
20:13-15 - A prophet delivers to Ahab God's promise of victory against
the Syrians, despite Israel's apparent military inferiority. Here, the
prophecy emphasizes God's sovereignty over the nations and His desire
Kings 13:17).
20:21-22 - Israel's victory over Syria demonstrates God's faithfulness
to His promise. However, the prophet warns Ahab of a new attack,
emphasizing the importance of vigilance and continued trust in God (see
20:28-30 - The Syrians believe that God is powerful only in the
mountains, but God grants Israel a new victory on the plains, showing
that He is sovereign over all creation. This event corrects the pagans'
20:42-43 - After the victory, Ahab spares Ben-hadad, contrary to God's
command. The prophet condemns Ahab for this disobedience, prophesying
that he will face the same fate as his enemy. This underscores the
Samuel 15:22-23).
