and the prophets and the others that followed them, on account of which
we should praise Israel for instruction and wisdom; and since it is
necessary not only that the readers themselves should acquire
understanding but also that those who love learning should be able to
help the outsiders by both speaking and writing, my grandfather Jesus,
after devoting himself especially to the reading of the law and the
prophets and the other books of our fathers, and after acquiring
considerable proficiency in them, was himself also led to write
something pertaining to instruction and wisdom, in order that, by
becoming conversant with this also, those who love learning should make
even greater progress in living according to the law.

to be indulgent in cases where, despite out diligent labor in
translating, we may seem to have rendered some phrases imperfectly. For
what was originally expressed in Hebrew does not have exactly the same
sense when translated into another language. Not only this work, but
even the law itself, the prophecies, and the rest of the books differ
not a little as originally expressed.
