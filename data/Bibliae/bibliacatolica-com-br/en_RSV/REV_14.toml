"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then I looked, and lo, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him a
hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father's name
written on their foreheads.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and
like the sound of loud thunder; the voice I heard was like the sound of
harpers playing on their harps,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four
living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song
except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from
the earth.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are
chaste; it is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes; these have
been redeemed from mankind as first fruits for God and the Lamb,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are spotless.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel
to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and
tongue and people;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and he said with a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, for the
hour of his judgment has come; and worship him who made heaven and
earth, the sea and the fountains of water."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Another angel, a second, followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is
Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of her
impure passion."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice,
"If any one worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on
his forehead or on his hand,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` he also shall drink the wine of God's wrath, poured unmixed into
the cup of his anger, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur
in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever; and they
have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its
image, and whoever receives the mark of its name."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the
commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this: Blessed are
the dead who die in the Lord henceforth." "Blessed indeed," says the
Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow
them!"
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then I looked, and lo, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one
like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle
in his hand.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice
to him who sat upon the cloud, "Put in your sickle, and reap, for the
hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So he who sat upon the cloud swung his sickle on the earth, and the
earth was reaped.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had
a sharp sickle.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has power
over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp
sickle, "Put in your sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the
earth, for its grapes are ripe."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the vintage
of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of
God;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed
from the wine press, as high as a horse's bridle, for one thousand six
hundred stadia.
