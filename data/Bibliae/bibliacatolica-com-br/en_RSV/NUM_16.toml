"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now Korah the son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan
and Abi'ram the sons of Eli'ab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of
Reuben,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` took men; and they rose up before Moses, with a number of the people
of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, chosen
from the assembly, well-known men;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against
Aaron, and said to them, "You have gone too far! For all the
congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them;
why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When Moses heard it, he fell on his face;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and he said to Korah and all his company, "In the morning the LORD
will show who is his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near
to him; him whom he will choose he will cause to come near to him.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Do this: take censers, Korah and all his company;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` put fire in them and put incense upon them before the LORD tomorrow,
and the man whom the LORD chooses shall be the holy one. You have gone
too far, sons of Levi!"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` is it too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has separated
you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to
do service in the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the
congregation to minister to them;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and that he has brought you near him, and all your brethren the
sons of Levi with you? And would you seek the priesthood also?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Therefore it is against the LORD that you and all your company have
gathered together; what is Aaron that you murmur against him?"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abi'ram the sons of Eli'ab; and
they said, "We will not come up.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land
flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you
must also make yourself a prince over us?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Moreover you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and
honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put
out the eyes of these men? We will not come up."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And Moses was very angry, and said to the LORD, "Do not respect
their offering. I have not taken one ass from them, and I have not
harmed one of them."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And Moses said to Korah, "Be present, you and all your company,
before the LORD, you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and let every one of you take his censer, and put incense upon it,
and every one of you bring before the LORD his censer, two hundred and
fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So every man took his censer, and they put fire in them and laid
incense upon them, and they stood at the entrance of the tent of
meeting with Moses and Aaron.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the
entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the LORD appeared to
all the congregation.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
consume them in a moment."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And they fell on their faces, and said, "O God, the God of the
spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry with
all the congregation?"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And the LORD said to Moses,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "Say to the congregation, Get away from about the dwelling of
Korah, Dathan, and Abi'ram."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abi'ram; and the elders of
Israel followed him.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And he said to the congregation, "Depart, I pray you, from the
tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be
swept away with all their sins."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So they got away from about the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and
Abi'ram; and Dathan and Abi'ram came out and stood at the door of their
tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And Moses said, "Hereby you shall know that the LORD has sent me to
do all these works, and that it has not been of my own accord.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` If these men die the common death of all men, or if they are
visited by the fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But if the LORD creates something new, and the ground opens its
mouth, and swallows them up, with all that belongs to them, and they go
down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised
the LORD."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And as he finished speaking all these words, the ground under them
split asunder;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their
households and all the men that belonged to Korah and all their goods.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol;
and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the
assembly.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And all Israel that were round about them fled at their cry; for
they said, "Lest the earth swallow us up!"
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And fire came forth from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and
fifty men offering the incense.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then the LORD said to Moses,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` "Tell Elea'zar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers
out of the blaze; then scatter the fire far and wide. For they are
holy,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their
lives; so let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the
altar, for they offered them before the LORD; therefore they are holy.
Thus they shall be a sign to the people of Israel."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` So Elea'zar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who
were burned had offered; and they were hammered out as a covering for
the altar,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` to be a reminder to the people of Israel, so that no one who is not
a priest, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, should draw near to
burn incense before the LORD, lest he become as Korah and as his
company -- as the LORD said to Elea'zar through Moses.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` But on the morrow all the congregation of the people of Israel
murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, "You have killed the
people of the LORD."
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And when the congregation had assembled against Moses and against
Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting; and behold, the cloud
covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` and the LORD said to Moses,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` "Get away from the midst of this congregation, that I may consume
them in a moment." And they fell on their faces.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer, and put fire therein
from off the altar, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the
congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone forth
from the LORD, the plague has begun."
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` So Aaron took it as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the
assembly; and behold, the plague had already begun among the people;
and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was
stopped.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven
hundred, besides those who died in the affair of Korah.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` And Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting,
when the plague was stopped.

Notas de rodap√©:
16:1-3 - Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebel against Moses and Aaron,
questioning their leadership. This rebellion reflects human
dissatisfaction and pride that opposes God's established authority (see
16:4-7 - Moses proposes a test to demonstrate whom God has chosen for
the priesthood, making it clear that the Lord is the one who
establishes spiritual leadership. This reinforces divine sovereignty in
5:4).
16:19-21 - God's glory appears to judge the rebels, underscoring God's
holiness and the gravity of rebellion. This shows that opposition to
16:31-33 - God judges Korah, Dathan, and Abiram by opening the earth to
swallow them, an act that serves as an example to the entire community
16:46-48 - Moses and Aaron intercede for the people, and Aaron offers
incense to stop the plague sent by God. This shows the importance of
intercession and the priesthood in God's plan of redemption (see also
