"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now the feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called the
Passover.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to
death; for they feared the people.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then Satan entered into Judas called Iscariot, who was of the number
of the twelve;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` he went away and conferred with the chief priests and officers how
he might betray him to them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And they were glad, and engaged to give him money.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So he agreed, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them in the
absence of the multitude.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, on which the passover lamb
had to be sacrificed.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the passover
for us, that we may eat it."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` They said to him, "Where will you have us prepare it?"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered the city, a man
carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him into the house which
he enters,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and tell the householder, `The Teacher says to you, Where is the
guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my disciples?'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he will show you a large upper room furnished; there make
ready."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And they went, and found it as he had told them; and they prepared
the passover.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when the hour came, he sat at table, and the apostles with him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he said to them, "I have earnestly desired to eat this passover
with you before I suffer;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` for I tell you I shall not eat it until it is fulfilled in the
kingdom of God."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he said, "Take
this, and divide it among yourselves;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` for I tell you that from now on I shall not drink of the fruit of
the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he took bread, and when he had given thanks he broke it and
gave it to them, saying, "This is my body which is given for you. Do
this in remembrance of me."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And likewise the cup after supper, saying, "This cup which is
poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But behold the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For the Son of man goes as it has been determined; but woe to that
man by whom he is betrayed!"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And they began to question one another, which of them it was that
would do this.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` A dispute also arose among them, which of them was to be regarded
as the greatest.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And he said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship
over them; and those in authority over them are called benefactors.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But not so with you; rather let the greatest among you become as
the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For which is the greater, one who sits at table, or one who serves?
Is it not the one who sits at table? But I am among you as one who
serves.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` "You are those who have continued with me in my trials;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and I assign to you, as my Father assigned to me, a kingdom,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might
sift you like wheat,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and when
you have turned again, strengthen your brethren."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And he said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and
to death."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` He said, "I tell you, Peter, the cock will not crow this day, until
you three times deny that you know me."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And he said to them, "When I sent you out with no purse or bag or
sandals, did you lack anything?" They said, "Nothing."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` He said to them, "But now, let him who has a purse take it, and
likewise a bag. And let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy
one.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, `And he
was reckoned with transgressors'; for what is written about me has its
fulfilment."
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And they said, "Look, Lord, here are two swords." And he said to
them, "It is enough."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And he came out, and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of
Olives; and the disciples followed him.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And when he came to the place he said to them, "Pray that you may
not enter into temptation."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and
prayed,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` "Father, if thou art willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless
not my will, but thine, be done."
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And when he rose from prayer, he came to the disciples and found
them sleeping for sorrow,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` and he said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may
not enter into temptation."
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called
Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to
kiss him;
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` but Jesus said to him, "Judas, would you betray the Son of man with
a kiss?"
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` And when those who were about him saw what would follow, they said,
"Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his
right ear.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` But Jesus said, "No more of this!" And he touched his ear and
healed him.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Then Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and
elders, who had come out against him, "Have you come out as against a
robber, with swords and clubs?
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay
hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high
priest's house. Peter followed at a distance;
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and
sat down together, Peter sat among them.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` Then a maid, seeing him as he sat in the light and gazing at him,
said, "This man also was with him."
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I do not know him."
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` And a little later some one else saw him and said, "You also are
one of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted,
saying, "Certainly this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean."
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying." And
immediately, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the
word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "Before the cock crows today,
you will deny me three times."
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` And he went out and wept bitterly.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him;
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` they also blindfolded him and asked him, "Prophesy! Who is it that
struck you?"
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` And they spoke many other words against him, reviling him.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` When day came, the assembly of the elders of the people gathered
together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to
their council, and they said,
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` "If you are the Christ, tell us." But he said to them, "If I tell
you, you will not believe;
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` and if I ask you, you will not answer.
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` But from now on the Son of man shall be seated at the right hand of
the power of God."
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` And they all said, "Are you the Son of God, then?" And he said to
them, "You say that I am."
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` And they said, "What further testimony do we need? We have heard it
ourselves from his own lips."
