"1" = ''':sup:`1` It happened also that seven brothers and their mother were arrested
and were being compelled by the king, under torture with whips and
cords, to partake of unlawful swine's flesh.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` One of them, acting as their spokesman, said, "What do you intend to
ask and learn from us? For we are ready to die rather than transgress
the laws of our fathers."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` The king fell into a rage, and gave orders that pans and caldrons be
heated.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` These were heated immediately, and he commanded that the tongue of
their spokesman be cut out and that they scalp him and cut off his
hands and feet, while the rest of the brothers and the mother looked
on.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When he was utterly helpless, the king ordered them to take him to
the fire, still breathing, and to fry him in a pan. The smoke from the
pan spread widely, but the brothers and their mother encouraged one
another to die nobly, saying,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` "The Lord God is watching over us and in truth has compassion on us,
as Moses declared in his song which bore witness against the people to
their faces, when he said, `And he will have compassion on his
servants.'"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` After the first brother had died in this way, they brought forward
the second for their sport. They tore off the skin of his head with the
hair, and asked him, "Will you eat rather than have your body punished
limb by limb?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He replied in the language of his fathers, and said to them, "No."
Therefore he in turn underwent tortures as the first brother had done.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when he was at his last breath, he said, "You accursed wretch,
you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe
will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have
died for his laws."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` After him, the third was the victim of their sport. When it was
demanded, he quickly put out his tongue and courageously stretched
forth his hands,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and said nobly, "I got these from Heaven, and because of his laws I
disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back again."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` As a result the king himself and those with him were astonished at
the young man's spirit, for he regarded his sufferings as nothing.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When he too had died, they maltreated and tortured the fourth in
the same way.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when he was near death, he said, "One cannot but choose to die
at the hands of men and to cherish the hope that God gives of being
raised again by him. But for you there will be no resurrection to
life!"
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Next they brought forward the fifth and maltreated him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But he looked at the king, and said, "Because you have authority
among men, mortal though you are, you do what you please. But do not
think that God has forsaken our people.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Keep on, and see how his mighty power will torture you and your
descendants!"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` After him they brought forward the sixth. And when he was about to
die, he said, "Do not deceive yourself in vain. For we are suffering
these things on our own account, because of our sins against our own
God. Therefore astounding things have happened.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But do not think that you will go unpunished for having tried to
fight against God!"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The mother was especially admirable and worthy of honorable memory.
Though she saw her seven sons perish within a single day, she bore it
with good courage because of her hope in the Lord.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` She encouraged each of them in the language of their fathers.
Filled with a noble spirit, she fired her woman's reasoning with a
man's courage, and said to them,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` "I do not know how you came into being in my womb. It was not I who
gave you life and breath, nor I who set in order the elements within
each of you.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Therefore the Creator of the world, who shaped the beginning of man
and devised the origin of all things, will in his mercy give life and
breath back to you again, since you now forget yourselves for the sake
of his laws."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Antiochus felt that he was being treated with contempt, and he was
suspicious of her reproachful tone. The youngest brother being still
alive, Antiochus not only appealed to him in words, but promised with
oaths that he would make him rich and enviable if he would turn from
the ways of his fathers, and that he would take him for his friend and
entrust him with public affairs.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Since the young man would not listen to him at all, the king called
the mother to him and urged her to advise the youth to save himself.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` After much urging on his part, she undertook to persuade her son.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But, leaning close to him, she spoke in their native tongue as
follows, deriding the cruel tyrant: "My son, have pity on me. I carried
you nine months in my womb, and nursed you for three years, and have
reared you and brought you up to this point in your life, and have
taken care of you.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` I beseech you, my child, to look at the heaven and the earth and
see everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make
them out of things that existed. Thus also mankind comes into being.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Do not fear this butcher, but prove worthy of your brothers. Accept
death, so that in God's mercy I may get you back again with your
brothers."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` While she was still speaking, the young man said, "What are you
waiting for? I will not obey the king's command, but I obey the command
of the law that was given to our fathers through Moses.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But you, who have contrived all sorts of evil against the Hebrews,
will certainly not escape the hands of God.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` For we are suffering because of our own sins.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And if our living Lord is angry for a little while, to rebuke and
discipline us, he will again be reconciled with his own servants.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But you, unholy wretch, you most defiled of all men, do not be
elated in vain and puffed up by uncertain hopes, when you raise your
hand against the children of heaven.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` You have not yet escaped the judgment of the almighty, all-seeing
God.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` For our brothers after enduring a brief suffering have drunk of
everflowing life under God's covenant; but you, by the judgment of God,
will receive just punishment for your arrogance.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` I, like my brothers, give up body and life for the laws of our
fathers, appealing to God to show mercy soon to our nation and by
afflictions and plagues to make you confess that he alone is God,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and through me and my brothers to bring to an end the wrath of the
Almighty which has justly fallen on our whole nation."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` The king fell into a rage, and handled him worse than the others,
being exasperated at his scorn.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` So he died in his integrity, putting his whole trust in the Lord.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Last of all, the mother died, after her sons.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Let this be enough, then, about the eating of sacrifices and the
extreme tortures.
'''
