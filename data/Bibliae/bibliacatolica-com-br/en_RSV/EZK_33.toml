"1" = ''':sup:`1` The word of the LORD came to me:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Son of man, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the
sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among
them, and make him their watchman;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet
and warns the people;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` then if any one who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take
warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be
upon his own head.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not take warning; his
blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have
saved his life.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the
trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes, and
takes any one of them; that man is taken away in his iniquity, but his
blood I will require at the watchman's hand.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` "So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel;
whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning
from me.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` If I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die, and you
do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked man
shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not
turn from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but you will have
saved your life.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` "And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus have you
said: `Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we waste away
because of them; how then can we live?'
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Say to them, As I live, says the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in
the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and
live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways; for why will you die, O
house of Israel?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And you, son of man, say to your people, The righteousness of the
righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses; and as for the
wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it when he turns from
his wickedness; and the righteous shall not be able to live by his
righteousness when he sins.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Though I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, yet if he
trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous
deeds shall be remembered; but in the iniquity that he has committed he
shall die.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Again, though I say to the wicked, `You shall surely die,' yet if
he turns from his sin and does what is lawful and right,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has taken by
robbery, and walks in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he
shall surely live, he shall not die.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` None of the sins that he has committed shall be remembered against
him; he has done what is lawful and right, he shall surely live.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` "Yet your people say, `The way of the Lord is not just'; when it is
their own way that is not just.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits
iniquity, he shall die for it.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does what is
lawful and right, he shall live by it.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Yet you say, `The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel,
I will judge each of you according to his ways."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth
day of the month, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and
said, "The city has fallen."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the
fugitive came; and he had opened my mouth by the time the man came to
me in the morning; so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer dumb.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` The word of the LORD came to me:
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "Son of man, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of
Israel keep saying, `Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of
the land; but we are many; the land is surely given us to possess.'
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: You eat flesh with
the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood; shall
you then possess the land?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` You resort to the sword, you commit abominations and each of you
defiles his neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Say this to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely those
who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in
the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured; and those who
are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And I will make the land a desolation and a waste; and her proud
might shall come to an end; and the mountains of Israel shall be so
desolate that none will pass through.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a
desolation and a waste because of all their abominations which they
have committed.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` "As for you, son of man, your people who talk together about you by
the walls and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to
his brother, `Come, and hear what the word is that comes forth from the
LORD.'
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And they come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my
people, and they hear what you say but they will not do it; for with
their lips they show much love, but their heart is set on their gain.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And, lo, you are to them like one who sings love songs with a
beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument, for they hear what you
say, but they will not do it.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` When this comes -- and come it will! -- then they will know that a
prophet has been among them."
