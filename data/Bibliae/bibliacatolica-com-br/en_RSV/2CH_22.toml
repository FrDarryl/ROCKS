"1" = ''':sup:`1` And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahazi'ah his youngest son king
in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabs to the camp
had slain all the older sons. So Ahazi'ah the son of Jeho'ram king of
Judah reigned.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Ahazi'ah was forty-two years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Athali'ah, the
granddaughter of Omri.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was
his counselor in doing wickedly.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab
had done; for after the death of his father they were his counselors,
to his undoing.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` He even followed their counsel, and went with Jeho'ram the son of
Ahab king of Israel to make war against Haz'ael king of Syria at
Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram,

"6" = ''':sup:`6` and he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which he had
received at Ramah, when he fought against Haz'ael king of Syria. And
Ahazi'ah the son of Jeho'ram king of Judah went down to see Joram the
son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But it was ordained by God that the downfall of Ahazi'ah should come
about through his going to visit Joram. For when he came there he went
out with Jeho'ram to meet Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had
anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.

the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahazi'ah's brothers, who attended
Ahazi'ah, and he killed them.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` He searched for Ahazi'ah, and he was captured while hiding in
Sama'ria, and he was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him,
for they said, "He is the grandson of Jehosh'aphat, who sought the LORD
with all his heart." And the house of Ahazi'ah had no one able to rule
the kingdom.

dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of
Judah.

of Ahazi'ah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were
about to be slain, and she put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. Thus
Jeho-shab'e-ath, the daughter of King Jeho'ram and wife of Jehoi'ada
the priest, because she was a sister of Ahazi'ah, hid him from
Athali'ah, so that she did not slay him;

Athali'ah reigned over the land.

Notas de rodapé:
22:1-4 - Ahaziah, son of Jehoram, reigns in Judah and follows the evil
ways of his mother Athaliah and father. Family influence is a
significant theme, showing how idolatrous practices can be passed down
13:22).
22:5-7 - Ahaziah allies with Jehoram, king of Israel, to fight Hazael
of Syria, demonstrating his pursuit of alliances that distance himself
from dependence on God. This alliance leads to his death, highlighting
the futility of trusting in human alliances rather than in God (see
22:8-9 - Ahaziah is killed during the battle, and his mother Athaliah
takes the throne. This transition of power highlights how corruption
can be perpetuated through wicked leaders and the importance of
34:2).
22:10-12 - Athaliah seeks to destroy the royal line, but Joash, son of
Ahaziah, is hidden and saved. This illustrates God’s providence in
preserving the faithful remnant, even in times of persecution (see also
22:13-15 - Athaliah's role as ruler is marked by idolatry and
corruption, representing a contrast to godly principles. Her reign
