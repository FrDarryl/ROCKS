"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he wept aloud, so that the Egyptians heard it, and the household
of Pharaoh heard it.

they came near. And he said, "I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold
into Egypt.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you
sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` And God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth,
and to keep alive for you many survivors.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So it was not you who sent me here, but God; and he has made me a

famine to come; lest you and your household, and all that you have,
come to poverty.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And now your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see,
that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` You must tell my father of all my splendor in Egypt, and of all
that you have seen. Make haste and bring my father down here."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept; and
Benjamin wept upon his neck.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them; and after that
his brothers talked with him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When the report was heard in Pharaoh's house, "Joseph's brothers
have come," it pleased Pharaoh and his servants well.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Say to your brothers, `Do this: load
your beasts and go back to the land of Canaan;

"18" = ''':sup:`18` and take your father and your households, and come to me, and I
will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall eat the fat
of the land.'

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Command them also, `Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for
your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Give no thought to your goods, for the best of all the land of
Egypt is yours.'"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons, according
to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` To each and all of them he gave festal garments; but to Benjamin he
gave three hundred shekels of silver and five festal garments.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` To his father he sent as follows: ten asses loaded with the good
things of Egypt, and ten she-asses loaded with grain, bread, and
provision for his father on the journey.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to
them, "Do not quarrel on the way."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So they went up out of Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to
their father Jacob.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And they told him, "Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all
the land of Egypt." And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But when they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him,
the spirit of their father Jacob revived;

"28" = ''':sup:`28` and Israel said, "It is enough; Joseph my son is still alive; I
will go and see him before I die."
