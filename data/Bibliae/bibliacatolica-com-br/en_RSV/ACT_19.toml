"1" = ''':sup:`1` While Apol'los was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country
and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you
believed?" And they said, "No, we have never even heard that there is a
Holy Spirit."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into
John's baptism."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance,
telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him,
that is, Jesus."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on
them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` There were about twelve of them in all.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly,
arguing and pleading about the kingdom of God;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but when some were stubborn and disbelieved, speaking evil of the
Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them, taking the
disciples with him, and argued daily in the hall of Tyran'nus.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia
heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And God did extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` so that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to
the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to pronounce
the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I
adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know;
but who are you?"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, mastered
all of them, and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house
naked and wounded.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And this became known to all residents of Ephesus, both Jews and
Greeks; and fear fell upon them all; and the name of the Lord Jesus was
extolled.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Many also of those who were now believers came, confessing and
divulging their practices.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And a number of those who practiced magic arts brought their books
together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the
value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So the word of the Lord grew and prevailed mightily.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through
Macedo'nia and Acha'ia and go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been
there, I must also see Rome."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And having sent into Macedo'nia two of his helpers, Timothy and
Eras'tus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` About that time there arose no little stir concerning the Way.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For a man named Deme'trius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines
of Ar'temis, brought no little business to the craftsmen.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` These he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation,
and said, "Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And you see and hear that not only at Ephesus but almost throughout
all Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable company
of people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into
disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Ar'temis may
count for nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her
magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When they heard this they were enraged, and cried out, "Great is
Ar'temis of the Ephesians!"
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` So the city was filled with the confusion; and they rushed together
into the theater, dragging with them Ga'ius and Aristar'chus,
Macedo'nians who were Paul's companions in travel.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Paul wished to go in among the crowd, but the disciples would not
let him;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` some of the A'si-archs also, who were friends of his, sent to him
and begged him not to venture into the theater.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Now some cried one thing, some another; for the assembly was in
confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put
forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, wishing to make a
defense to the people.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours
they all with one voice cried out, "Great is Ar'temis of the
Ephesians!"
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "Men of
Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the
Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Ar'temis, and of the sacred
stone that fell from the sky?
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Seeing then that these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to
be quiet and do nothing rash.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious
nor blasphemers of our goddess.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` If therefore Deme'trius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint
against any one, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let
them bring charges against one another.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the
regular assembly.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, there
being no cause that we can give to justify this commotion."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And when he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
'''

Notas de rodap√©:
19:1-7 - Paul encounters disciples in Ephesus who had not received the
Holy Spirit and instructs them to be baptized correctly. This shows the
importance of fully understanding the gospel and the work of the Spirit
19:11-12 - God performs extraordinary miracles through Paul, including
healing the sick and casting out evil spirits. These miracles confirm
Paul's divine authority and the truth of the message he preaches (see
19:23-27 - The Ephesian artisans, who make idols, are outraged by
Paul's preaching because it threatens their profits. The clash between
the gospel and idolatrous practices is a recurring theme in the New
