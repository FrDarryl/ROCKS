[8]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` And Saul was consenting to his death. And on that day a great
persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem; and they were all
scattered throughout the region of Judea and Sama'ria, except the
apostles.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he
dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Philip went down to a city of Sama'ria, and proclaimed to them the
Christ.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to what was said by
Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs which he did.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with
a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So there was much joy in that city.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But there was a man named Simon who had previously practiced magic
in the city and amazed the nation of Sama'ria, saying that he himself
was somebody great.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` They all gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest, saying,
"This man is that power of God which is called Great."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed
them with his magic.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the
kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both
men and women.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued
with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was
amazed.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Sama'ria had received
the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy
Spirit;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` for it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy
Spirit.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on
of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` saying, "Give me also this power, that any one on whom I lay my
hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Peter said to him, "Your silver perish with you, because you
thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not
right before God.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord
that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of
iniquity."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what
you have said may come upon me."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they
returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the
Samaritans.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Rise and go toward the
south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." This is a
desert road.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And he rose and went. And behold, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a
minister of the Can'dace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of all her
treasure, had come to Jerusalem to worship
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and was returning; seated in his chariot, he was reading the
prophet Isaiah.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And the Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and
asked, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And he said, "How can I, unless some one guides me?" And he invited
Philip to come up and sit with him.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this: "As
a sheep led to the slaughter or a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so
he opens not his mouth.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his
generation? For his life is taken up from the earth."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And the eunuch said to Philip, "About whom, pray, does the prophet
say this, about himself or about some one else?"
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture he
told him the good news of Jesus.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And as they went along the road they came to some water, and the
eunuch said, "See, here is water! What is to prevent my being
baptized?"
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into
the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord
caught up Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way
rejoicing.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` But Philip was found at Azo'tus, and passing on he preached the
gospel to all the towns till he came to Caesare'a.
