"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Holofernes, the general of the Assyrian army, heard that the
people of Israel had prepared for war and had closed the passes in the
hills and fortified all the high hilltops and set up barricades in the
plains,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` he was very angry. So he called together all the princes of Moab and
the commanders of Ammon and all the governors of the coastland,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and said to them, "Tell me, you Canaanites, what people is this that
lives in the hill country? What cities do they inhabit? How large is
their army, and in what does their power or strength consist? Who rules
over them as king, leading their army?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And why have they alone, of all who live in the west, refused to
come out and meet me?"
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then Achior, the leader of all the Ammonites, said to him, "Let my
lord now hear a word from the mouth of your servant, and I will tell
you the truth about this people that dwells in the nearby mountain
district. No falsehood shall come from your servant's mouth.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` This people is descended from the Chaldeans.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` At one time they lived in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow
the gods of their fathers who were in Chaldea.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For they had left the ways of their ancestors, and they worshiped
the God of heaven, the God they had come to know; hence they drove them
out from the presence of their gods; and they fled to Mesopotamia, and
lived there for a long time.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then their God commanded them to leave the place where they were
living and go to the land of Canaan. There they settled, and prospered,
with much gold and silver and very many cattle.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When a famine spread over Canaan they went down to Egypt and lived
there as long as they had food; and there they became a great multitude
-- so great that they could not be counted.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So the king of Egypt became hostile to them; he took advantage of
them and set them to making bricks, and humbled them and made slaves of
them.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then they cried out to their God, and he afflicted the whole land
of Egypt with incurable plagues; and so the Egyptians drove them out of
their sight.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then God dried up the Red Sea before them,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and he led them by the way of Sinai and Kadesh-barnea, and drove
out all the people of the wilderness.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So they lived in the land of the Amorites, and by their might
destroyed all the inhabitants of Heshbon; and crossing over the Jordan
they took possession of all the hill country.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And they drove out before them the Canaanites and the Perizzites
and the Jebusites and the Shechemites and all the Gergesites, and lived
there a long time.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` As long as they did not sin against their God they prospered, for
the God who hates iniquity is with them.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But when they departed from the way which he had appointed for
them, they were utterly defeated in many battles and were led away
captive to a foreign country; the temple of their God was razed to the
ground, and their cities were captured by their enemies.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But now they have returned to their God, and have come back from
the places to which they were scattered, and have occupied Jerusalem,
where their sanctuary is, and have settled in the hill country, because
it was uninhabited.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now therefore, my master and lord, if there is any unwitting error
in this people and they sin against their God and we find out their
offense, then we will go up and defeat them.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But if there is no transgression in their nation, then let my lord
pass them by; for their Lord will defend them, and their God will
protect them, and we shall be put to shame before the whole world."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When Achior had finished saying this, all the men standing around
the tent began to complain; Holofernes' officers and all the men from
the seacoast and from Moab insisted that he must be put to death.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "For," they said, "we will not be afraid of the Israelites; they
are a people with no strength or power for making war.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Therefore let us go up, Lord Holofernes, and they will be devoured
by your vast army."
