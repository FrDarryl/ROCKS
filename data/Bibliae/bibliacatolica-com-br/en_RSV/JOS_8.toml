"1" = ''':sup:`1` And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear or be dismayed; take all
the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given
into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its
king; only its spoil and its cattle you shall take as booty for
yourselves; lay an ambush against the city, behind it."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So Joshua arose, and all the fighting men, to go up to Ai; and
Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them forth
by night.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And he commanded them, "Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the
city, behind it; do not go very far from the city, but hold yourselves
all in readiness;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach the city.
And when they come out against us, as before, we shall flee before
them;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from
the city; for they will say, `They are fleeing from us, as before.' So
we will flee from them;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize the city; for the
LORD your God will give it into your hand.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And when you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire,
doing as the LORD has bidden; see, I have commanded you."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the place of ambush, and
lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent that
night among the people.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people, and
went up, with the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And all the fighting men who were with him went up, and drew near
before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine
between them and Ai.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between
Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So they stationed the forces, the main encampment which was north
of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that
night in the valley.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when the king of Ai saw this he and all his people, the men of
the city, made haste and went out early to the descent toward the
Arabah to meet Israel in battle; but he did not know that there was an
ambush against him behind the city.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And Joshua and all Israel made a pretense of being beaten before
them, and fled in the direction of the wilderness.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So all the people who were in the city were called together to
pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the
city.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, who did not go out after
Israel; they left the city open, and pursued Israel.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in
your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand." And Joshua
stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he
had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and took it;
and they made haste to set the city on fire.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city
went up to heaven; and they had no power to flee this way or that, for
the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the
city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and
smote the men of Ai.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And the others came forth from the city against them; so they were
in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and
Israel smote them, until there was left none that survived or escaped.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When Israel had finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in
the open wilderness where they pursued them and all of them to the very
last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai,
and smote it with the edge of the sword.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve
thousand, all the people of Ai.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out
the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as their
booty, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So Joshua burned Ai, and made it for ever a heap of ruins, as it is
to this day.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at the
going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down
from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and
raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then Joshua built an altar in Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of
Israel,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the people of
Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, "an altar of
unhewn stones, upon which no man has lifted an iron tool"; and they
offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace
offerings.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote upon
the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And all Israel, sojourner as well as homeborn, with their elders
and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark
before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the
LORD, half of them in front of Mount Ger'izim and half of them in front
of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the
first, that they should bless the people of Israel.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and
the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua did
not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the
little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.
