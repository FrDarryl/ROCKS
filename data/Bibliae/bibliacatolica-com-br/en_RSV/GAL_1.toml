Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead --
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and all the brethren who are with me, To the churches of Galatia:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus
Christ,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil
age, according to the will of our God and Father;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you
in the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel --
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` not that there is another gospel, but there are some who trouble you
and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a
gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I trying to

through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted
the church of God violently and tried to destroy it;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my
people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and had called
me through his grace,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach
him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with flesh and blood,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me,
but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and
remained with him fifteen days.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's
brother.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!)
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cili'cia.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` And I was still not known by sight to the churches of Christ in
Judea;

preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."

"24" = ''':sup:`24` And they glorified God because of me.
