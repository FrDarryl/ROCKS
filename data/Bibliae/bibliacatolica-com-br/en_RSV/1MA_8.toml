"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now Judas heard of the fame of the Romans, that they were very
strong and were well-disposed toward all who made an alliance with
them, that they pledged friendship to those who came to them,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and that they were very strong. Men told him of their wars and of
the brave deeds which they were doing among the Gauls, how they had
defeated them and forced them to pay tribute,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and what they had done in the land of Spain to get control of the
silver and gold mines there,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and how they had gained control of the whole region by their
planning and patience, even though the place was far distant from them.
They also subdued the kings who came against them from the ends of the
earth, until they crushed them and inflicted great disaster upon them;
the rest paid them tribute every year.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Philip, and Perseus king of the Macedonians, and the others who rose
up against them, they crushed in battle and conquered.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` They also defeated Antiochus the Great, king of Asia, who went to
fight against them with a hundred and twenty elephants and with cavalry
and chariots and a very large army. He was crushed by them;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` they took him alive and decreed that he and those who should reign
after him should pay a heavy tribute and give hostages and surrender
some of their best provinces,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` the country of India and Media and Lydia. These they took from him
and gave to Eumenes the king.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The Greeks planned to come and destroy them,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` but this became known to them, and they sent a general against the
Greeks and attacked them. Many of them were wounded and fell, and the
Romans took captive their wives and children; they plundered them,
conquered the land, tore down their strongholds, and enslaved them to
this day.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The remaining kingdoms and islands, as many as ever opposed them,
they destroyed and enslaved;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` but with their friends and those who rely on them they have kept
friendship. They have subdued kings far and near, and as many as have
heard of their fame have feared them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Those whom they wish to help and to make kings, they make kings,
and those whom they wish they depose; and they have been greatly
exalted.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Yet for all this not one of them has put on a crown or worn purple
as a mark of pride,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` but they have built for themselves a senate chamber, and every day
three hundred and twenty senators constantly deliberate concerning the
people, to govern them well.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` They trust one man each year to rule over them and to control all
their land; they all heed the one man, and there is no envy or jealousy
among them.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Judas chose Eupolemus the son of John, son of Accos, and Jason
the son of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome to establish friendship and
alliance,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and to free themselves from the yoke; for they saw that the kingdom
of the Greeks was completely enslaving Israel.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They went to Rome, a very long journey; and they entered the senate
chamber and spoke as follows:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` "Judas, who is also called Maccabeus, and his brothers and the
people of the Jews have sent us to you to establish alliance and peace
with you, that we may be enrolled as your allies and friends."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The proposal pleased them,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and this is a copy of the letter which they wrote in reply, on
bronze tablets, and sent to Jerusalem to remain with them there as a
memorial of peace and alliance:
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "May all go well with the Romans and with the nation of the Jews at
sea and on land for ever, and may sword and enemy be far from them.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` If war comes first to Rome or to any of their allies in all their
dominion,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` the nation of the Jews shall act as their allies wholeheartedly, as
the occasion may indicate to them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And to the enemy who makes war they shall not give or supply grain,
arms, money, or ships, as Rome has decided; and they shall keep their
obligations without receiving any return.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` In the same way, if war comes first to the nation of the Jews, the
Romans shall willingly act as their allies, as the occasion may
indicate to them.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And to the enemy allies shall be given no grain, arms, money, or
ships, as Rome has decided; and they shall keep these obligations and
do so without deceit.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Thus on these terms the Romans make a treaty with the Jewish
people.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` If after these terms are in effect both parties shall determine to
add or delete anything, they shall do so at their discretion, and any
addition or deletion that they may make shall be valid.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` "And concerning the wrongs which King Demetrius is doing to them we
have written to him as follows, `Why have you made your yoke heavy upon
our friends and allies the Jews?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` If now they appeal again for help against you, we will defend their
rights and fight you on sea and on land.'"
