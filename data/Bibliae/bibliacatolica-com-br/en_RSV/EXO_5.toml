let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and moreover I will not let
Israel go."

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us; let us go,
we pray, a three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to
the LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the
sword."

"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the king of Egypt said to them, "Moses and Aaron, why do you
take the people away from their work? Get to your burdens."

"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many and
you make them rest from their burdens!"

"6" = ''':sup:`6` The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and
their foremen,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` "You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as
heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` But the number of bricks which they made heretofore you shall lay
upon them, you shall by no means lessen it; for they are idle;
therefore they cry, `Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Let heavier work be laid upon the men that they may labor at it and

"10" = ''':sup:`10` So the taskmasters and the foremen of the people went out and said
to the people, "Thus says Pharaoh, `I will not give you straw.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of

"13" = ''':sup:`13` The taskmasters were urgent, saying, "Complete your work, your
daily task, as when there was straw."

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the foremen of the people of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters
had set over them, were beaten, and were asked, "Why have you not done
all your task of making bricks today, as hitherto?"

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then the foremen of the people of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh,
"Why do you deal thus with your servants?

"16" = ''':sup:`16` No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, `Make
bricks!' And behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your
own people."

"17" = ''':sup:`17` But he said, "You are idle, you are idle; therefore you say, `Let
us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Go now, and work; for no straw shall be given you, yet you shall
deliver the same number of bricks."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The foremen of the people of Israel saw that they were in evil
plight, when they said, "You shall by no means lessen your daily number
of bricks."

"20" = ''':sup:`20` They met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them, as they came
forth from Pharaoh;

"21" = ''':sup:`21` and they said to them, "The LORD look upon you and judge, because
you have made us offensive in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants,
and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then Moses turned again to the LORD and said, "O LORD, why hast
thou done evil to this people? Why didst thou ever send me?

"23" = ''':sup:`23` For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he has done evil
to this people, and thou hast not delivered thy people at all."
