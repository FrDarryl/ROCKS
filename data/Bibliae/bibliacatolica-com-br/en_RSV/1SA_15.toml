"1" = ''':sup:`1` And Samuel said to Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you king over
his people Israel; now therefore hearken to the words of the LORD.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Thus says the LORD of hosts, `I will punish what Am'alek did to
Israel in opposing them on the way, when they came up out of Egypt.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now go and smite Am'alek, and utterly destroy all that they have; do
not spare them, but kill both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox
and sheep, camel and ass.'"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Tela'im, two
hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Saul came to the city of Am'alek, and lay in wait in the valley.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Saul said to the Ken'ites, "Go, depart, go down from among the
Amal'ekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to
all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt." So the
Ken'ites departed from among the Amal'ekites.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Saul defeated the Amal'ekites, from Hav'ilah as far as Shur,
which is east of Egypt.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he took Agag the king of the Amal'ekites alive, and utterly
destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and
of the oxen and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good,
and would not utterly destroy them; all that was despised and worthless
they utterly destroyed.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The word of the LORD came to Samuel:
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "I repent that I have made Saul king; for he has turned back from
following me, and has not performed my commandments." And Samuel was
angry; and he cried to the LORD all night.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told
Samuel, "Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for
himself and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, "Blessed be you to
the LORD; I have performed the commandment of the LORD."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of the sheep in my
ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?"
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Saul said, "They have brought them from the Amal'ekites; for the
people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to
the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! I will tell you what the LORD said
to me this night." And he said to him, "Say on."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Samuel said, "Though you are little in your own eyes, are you
not the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over
Israel.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, `Go, utterly destroy
the sinners, the Amal'ekites, and fight against them until they are
consumed.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD? Why did you swoop
on the spoil, and do what was evil in the sight of the LORD?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Saul said to Samuel, "I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, I
have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me, I have brought Agag
the king of Am'alek, and I have utterly destroyed the Amal'ekites.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the
things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in
Gilgal."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And Samuel said, "Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings
and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is
better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and stubbornness is as
iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD,
he has also rejected you from being king."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; for I have transgressed
the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people
and obeyed their voice.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Now therefore, I pray, pardon my sin, and return with me, that I
may worship the LORD."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you; for you have
rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being
king over Israel."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` As Samuel turned to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his
robe, and it tore.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel
from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is
better than you.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And also the Glory of Israel will not lie or repent; for he is not
a man, that he should repent."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then he said, "I have sinned; yet honor me now before the elders of
my people and before Israel, and return with me, that I may worship the
LORD your God."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So Samuel turned back after Saul; and Saul worshiped the LORD.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then Samuel said, "Bring here to me Agag the king of the
Amal'ekites." And Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, "Surely the
bitterness of death is past."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so shall
your mother be childless among women." And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces
before the LORD in Gilgal.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house in
Gib'e-ah of Saul.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but
Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD repented that he had made Saul
king over Israel.

Notas de rodapé:
15:1-3 - God, through Samuel, commands Saul to completely destroy the
Amalekites, a nation that was an enemy of Israel. This is a clear
command that tests Saul's complete obedience to God (see also
15:9-11 - Saul and the people disobey God by sparing King Agag and the
best of their flocks. This reveals Saul's failure to follow God's
commands completely, resulting in the rejection of his kingship (see
15:22-23 - Samuel confronts Saul, saying that “to obey is better than
sacrifice.” The central lesson here is that God values obedience and
submission to His will more than any external ritual (see also
15:24-26 - Saul confesses his sin, but his motivation is fear of the
people rather than genuine repentance. Samuel reaffirms that God has
rejected him as king, establishing that a leader's heart is more
Corinthians 7:10).
15:32-33 - Samuel executes King Agag, completing the order Saul failed
to carry out. This underscores Samuel's zeal for God's justice and the
