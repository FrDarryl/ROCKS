'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you
hear my words."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was working at
his wheel.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's
hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the
potter to do.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then the word of the LORD came to me:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` "O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done?
says the LORD. Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you
in my hand, O house of Israel.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I
will pluck up and break down and destroy it,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its
evil, I will repent of the evil that I intended to do to it.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I
will build and plant it,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I
will repent of the good which I had intended to do to it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem: `Thus says the LORD, Behold, I am shaping evil against you
and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way,
and amend your ways and your doings.'
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` "But they say, `That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and

"13" = ''':sup:`13` "Therefore thus says the LORD: Ask among the nations, who has heard
the like of this? The virgin Israel has done a very horrible thing.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Does the snow of Lebanon leave the crags of Si'rion? Do the
mountain waters run dry, the cold flowing streams?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But my people have forgotten me, they burn incense to false gods;
they have stumbled in their ways, in the ancient roads, and have gone
into bypaths, not the highway,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` making their land a horror, a thing to be hissed at for ever. Every
one who passes by it is horrified and shakes his head.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Like the east wind I will scatter them before the enemy. I will
show them my back, not my face, in the day of their calamity."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then they said, "Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the
law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor
the word from the prophet. Come, let us smite him with the tongue, and
let us not heed any of his words."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to my plea.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Is evil a recompense for good? Yet they have dug a pit for my life.
Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, to turn away
thy wrath from them.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Therefore deliver up their children to famine; give them over to
the power of the sword, let their wives become childless and widowed.
May their men meet death by pestilence, their youths be slain by the
sword in battle.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` May a cry be heard from their houses, when thou bringest the
marauder suddenly upon them! For they have dug a pit to take me, and
laid snares for my feet.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Yet, thou, O LORD, knowest all their plotting to slay me. Forgive
not their iniquity, nor blot out their sin from thy sight. Let them be
overthrown before thee; deal with them in the time of thine anger.
