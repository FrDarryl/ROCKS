"23" = ''':sup:`23` For he has not appointed a time for any man to go before God in
judgment.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` Thus, knowing their works, he overturns them in the night, and they
are crushed.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` He strikes them for their wickedness in the sight of men,

heard the cry of the afflicted --

behold him, whether it be a nation or a man? --

"30" = ''':sup:`30` that a godless man should not reign, that he should not ensnare the
people.

"31" = ''':sup:`31` "For has any one said to God, `I have borne chastisement; I will

no more'?
