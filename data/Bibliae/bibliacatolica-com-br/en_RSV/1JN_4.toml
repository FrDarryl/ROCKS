that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` They are of the world, therefore what they say is of the world, and
the world listens to them.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and he who is not of
God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the
