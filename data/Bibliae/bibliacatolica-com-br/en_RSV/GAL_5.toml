5:1 - Freedom in Christ is the key to the Christian life, and Paul
exhorts the Galatians to stand firm in this freedom, without submitting
again to the yoke of slavery. Freedom is central to the gospel (see
5:13-15 - Paul teaches that Christian freedom should be used to serve

flesh. Life in the Spirit is a constant struggle against the desires of
the flesh, but it enables us to live according to God's will (see also

flesh, showing that a life in Christ results in virtues such as love,
peace, and kindness. These fruits reflect the inner transformation
5:24-26 - Paul teaches that those who belong to Christ have crucified
