mercy and truth, and thou dost render true and righteous judgment for

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Remember me and look favorably upon me; do not punish me for my sins
and for my unwitting offences and those which my fathers committed
before thee.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` For they disobeyed thy commandments, and thou gavest us over to
plunder, captivity, and death; thou madest us a byword of reproach in
all the nations among which we have been dispersed.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now thy many judgments are true in exacting penalty from me for
my sins and those of my fathers, because we did not keep thy
commandments. For we did not walk in truth before thee.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And now deal with me according to thy pleasure; command my spirit to
be taken up, that I may depart and become dust. For it is better for me
to die than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and great
is the sorrow within me. Command that I now be released from my
distress to go to the eternal abode; do not turn thy face away from

"7" = ''':sup:`7` On the same day, at Ecbatana in Media, it also happened that Sarah,
the daughter of Raguel, was reproached by her father's maids,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` because she had been given to seven husbands, and the evil demon
Asmodeus had slain each of them before he had been with her as his
wife. So the maids said to her, "Do you not know that you strangle your

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Why do you beat us? If they are dead, go with them! May we never see

"10" = ''':sup:`10` When she heard these things she was deeply grieved, even to the
thought of hanging herself. But she said, "I am the only child of my
father; if I do this, it will be a disgrace to him, and I shall bring
his old age down in sorrow to the grave.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` So she prayed by her window and said, "Blessed art thou, O Lord my
God, and blessed is thy holy and honored name for ever. May all thy
works praise thee for ever.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` And now, O Lord, I have turned my eyes and my face toward thee.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Command that I be released from the earth and that I hear reproach
no more.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Thou knowest, O Lord, that I am innocent of any sin with man,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and that I did not stain my name or the name of my father in the
land of my captivity. I am my father's only child, and he has no child
to be his heir, no near kinsman or kinsman's son for whom I should keep
myself as wife. Already seven husbands of mine are dead. Why should I
live? But if it be not pleasing to thee to take my life, command that
respect be shown to me and pity be taken upon me, and that I hear
reproach no more."

"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Raphael was sent to heal the two of them: to scale away the
white films of Tobit's eyes; to give Sarah the daughter of Raguel in
marriage to Tobias the son of Tobit, and to bind Asmodeus the evil
demon, because Tobias was entitled to possess her. At that very moment
Tobit returned and entered his house and Sarah the daughter of Raguel
came down from her upper room.
