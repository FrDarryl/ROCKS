Notas de rodap√©:
6:1-2 - Paul exhorts the Corinthians not to receive God's grace in
vain, emphasizing the urgency of salvation. The "today" of salvation is
a continual invitation to personal transformation and conversion (see
6:3-10 - Paul describes the hardships and sufferings he and the other

Corinthians 4:11-13).
6:14-18 - Paul warns Christians about the incompatibility of
righteousness and wickedness. Separation from the world and commitment
06:17 - Come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord.
