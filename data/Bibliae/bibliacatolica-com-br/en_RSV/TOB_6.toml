"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now as they proceeded on their way they came at evening to the
Tigris river and camped there.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then the young man went down to wash himself. A fish leaped up from
the river and would have swallowed the young man;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and the angel said to him, "Catch the fish." So the young man seized
the fish and threw it up on the land.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then the angel said to him, "Cut open the fish and take the heart
and liver and gall and put them away safely."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So the young man did as the angel told him; and they roasted and ate
the fish. And they both continued on their way until they came near to
Ecbatana.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then the young man said to the angel, "Brother Azarias, of what use
is the liver and heart and gall of the fish?"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He replied, "As for the heart and liver, if a demon or evil spirit
gives trouble to any one, you make a smoke from these before the man or
woman, and that person will never be troubled again.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And as for the gall, anoint with it a man who has white films in his
eyes, and he will be cured."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When they approached Ecbatana,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` the angel said to the young man, "Brother, today we shall stay with
Raguel. He is your relative, and he has an only daughter named Sarah. I
will suggest that she be given to you in marriage,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` because you are entitled to her and to her inheritance, for you are
her only eligible kinsman.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The girl is also beautiful and sensible. Now listen to my plan. I
will speak to her father, and as soon as we return from Rages we will
celebrate the marriage. For I know that Raguel, according to the law of
Moses, cannot give her to another man without incurring the penalty of
death, because you rather than any other man are entitled to the
inheritance."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then the young man said to the angel, "Brother Azarias, I have
heard that the girl has been given to seven husbands and that each died
in the bridal chamber.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now I am the only son my father has, and I am afraid that if I go
in I will die as those before me did, for a demon is in love with her,
and he harms no one except those who approach her. So now I fear that I
may die and bring the lives of my father and mother to the grave in
sorrow on my account. And they have no other son to bury them."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But the angel said to him, "Do you not remember the words with
which your father commanded you to take a wife from among your own
people? Now listen to me, brother, for she will become your wife; and
do not worry about the demon, for this very night she will be given to
you in marriage.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When you enter the bridal chamber, you shall take live ashes of
incense and lay upon them some of the heart and liver of the fish so as
to make a smoke.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then the demon will smell it and flee away, and will never again
return. And when you approach her, rise up, both of you, and cry out to
the merciful God, and he will save you and have mercy on you. Do not be
afraid, for she was destined for you from eternity. You will save her,
and she will go with you, and I suppose that you will have children by
her." When Tobias heard these things, he fell in love with her and
yearned deeply for her.
