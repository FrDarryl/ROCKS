"1" = ''':sup:`1` Again, one preparing to sail and about to voyage over raging waves
calls upon a piece of wood more fragile than the ship which carries
him.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` For it was desire for gain that planned that vessel, and wisdom was
the craftsman who built it;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` but it is thy providence, O Father, that steers its course, because
thou hast given it a path in the sea, and a safe way through the waves,

"4" = ''':sup:`4` showing that thou canst save from every danger, so that even if a
man lacks skill, he may put to sea.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` It is thy will that works of thy wisdom should not be without
effect; therefore men trust their lives even to the smallest piece of
wood, and passing through the billows on a raft they come safely to
land.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For even in the beginning, when arrogant giants were perishing, the
hope of the world took refuge on a raft, and guided by thy hand left to
the world the seed of a new generation.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` But the idol made with hands is accursed, and so is he who made it;
because he did the work, and the perishable thing was named a god.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For equally hateful to God are the ungodly man and his ungodliness,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` for what was done will be punished together with him who did it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Therefore there will be a visitation also upon the heathen idols,
because, though part of what God created, they became an abomination,
and became traps for the souls of men and a snare to the feet of the
foolish.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For the idea of making idols was the beginning of fornication, and
the invention of them was the corruption of life,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` for neither have they existed from the beginning nor will they
exist for ever.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For through the vanity of men they entered the world, and therefore
their speedy end has been planned.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For a father, consumed with grief at an untimely bereavement, made
an image of his child, who had been suddenly taken from him; and he now
honored as a god what was once a dead human being, and handed on to his
dependents secret rites and initiations.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then the ungodly custom, grown strong with time, was kept as a law,
and at the command of monarchs graven images were worshiped.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` When men could not honor monarchs in their presence, since they
lived at a distance, they imagined their appearance far away, and made
a visible image of the king whom they honored, so that by their zeal
they might flatter the absent one as though present.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then the ambition of the craftsman impelled even those who did not
know the king to intensify their worship.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For he, perhaps wishing to please his ruler, skilfully forced the
likeness to take more beautiful form,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and the multitude, attracted by the charm of his work, now regarded
as an object of worship the one whom shortly before they had honored as
a man.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And this became a hidden trap for mankind, because men, in bondage
to misfortune or to royal authority, bestowed on objects of stone or
wood the name that ought not to be shared.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Afterward it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of
God, but they live in great strife due to ignorance, and they call such
great evils peace.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For whether they kill children in their initiations, or celebrate
secret mysteries, or hold frenzied revels with strange customs,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` they no longer keep either their lives or their marriages pure, but
they either treacherously kill one another, or grieve one another by
adultery,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and all is a raging riot of blood and murder, theft and deceit,
corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` confusion over what is good, forgetfulness of favors, pollution of
souls, sex perversion, disorder in marriage, adultery, and debauchery.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For the worship of idols not to be named is the beginning and cause
and end of every evil.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` For their worshipers either rave in exultation, or prophesy lies,
or live unrighteously, or readily commit perjury;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` for because they trust in lifeless idols they swear wicked oaths
and expect to suffer no harm.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But just penalties will overtake them on two counts: because they
thought wickedly of God in devoting themselves to idols, and because in
deceit they swore unrighteously through contempt for holiness.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` For it is not the power of the things by which men swear, but the
just penalty for those who sin, that always pursues the transgression
of the unrighteous.
