"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Nicanor heard that Judas and his men were in the region of
Samaria, he made plans to attack them with complete safety on the day
of rest.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And when the Jews who were compelled to follow him said, "Do not
destroy so savagely and barbarously, but show respect for the day which
he who sees all things has honored and hallowed above other days,"
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` the thrice-accursed wretch asked if there were a sovereign in heaven
who had commanded the keeping of the sabbath day.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And when they declared, "It is the living Lord himself, the
Sovereign in heaven, who ordered us to observe the seventh day,"
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` he replied, "And I am a sovereign also, on earth, and I command you
to take up arms and finish the king's business." Nevertheless, he did
not succeed in carrying out his abominable design.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` This Nicanor in his utter boastfulness and arrogance had determined
to erect a public monument of victory over Judas and his men.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But Maccabeus did not cease to trust with all confidence that he
would get help from the Lord.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he exhorted his men not to fear the attack of the Gentiles, but
to keep in mind the former times when help had come to them from
heaven, and now to look for the victory which the Almighty would give
them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Encouraging them from the law and the prophets, and reminding them
also of the struggles they had won, he made them the more eager.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And when he had aroused their courage, he gave his orders, at the
same time pointing out the perfidy of the Gentiles and their violation
of oaths.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He armed each of them not so much with confidence in shields and
spears as with the inspiration of brave words, and he cheered them all
by relating a dream, a sort of vision, which was worthy of belief.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` What he saw was this: Onias, who had been high priest, a noble and
good man, of modest bearing and gentle manner, one who spoke fittingly
and had been trained from childhood in all that belongs to excellence,
was praying with outstretched hands for the whole body of the Jews.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then likewise a man appeared, distinguished by his gray hair and
dignity, and of marvelous majesty and authority.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Onias spoke, saying, "This is a man who loves the brethren and
prays much for the people and the holy city, Jeremiah, the prophet of
God."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Jeremiah stretched out his right hand and gave to Judas a golden
sword, and as he gave it he addressed him thus:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with which you will strike
down your adversaries."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Encouraged by the words of Judas, so noble and so effective in
arousing valor and awaking manliness in the souls of the young, they
determined not to carry on a campaign but to attack bravely, and to
decide the matter, by fighting hand to hand with all courage, because
the city and the sanctuary and the temple were in danger.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Their concern for wives and children, and also for brethren and
relatives, lay upon them less heavily; their greatest and first fear
was for the consecrated sanctuary.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And those who had to remain in the city were in no little distress,
being anxious over the encounter in the open country.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When all were now looking forward to the coming decision, and the
enemy was already close at hand with their army drawn up for battle,
the elephants strategically stationed and the cavalry deployed on the
flanks,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Maccabeus, perceiving the hosts that were before him and the varied
supply of arms and the savagery of the elephants, stretched out his
hands toward heaven and called upon the Lord who works wonders; for he
knew that it is not by arms, but as the Lord decides, that he gains the
victory for those who deserve it.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And he called upon him in these words: "O Lord, thou didst send thy
angel in the time of Hezekiah king of Judea, and he slew fully a
hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of Sennacherib.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So now, O Sovereign of the heavens, send a good angel to carry
terror and trembling before us.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` By the might of thy arm may these blasphemers who come against thy
holy people be struck down." With these words he ended his prayer.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Nicanor and his men advanced with trumpets and battle songs;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and Judas and his men met the enemy in battle with invocation to
God and prayers.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So, fighting with their hands and praying to God in their hearts,
they laid low no less than thirty-five thousand men, and were greatly
gladdened by God's manifestation.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When the action was over and they were returning with joy, they
recognized Nicanor, lying dead, in full armor.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then there was shouting and tumult, and they blessed the Sovereign
Lord in the language of their fathers.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And the man who was ever in body and soul the defender of his
fellow citizens, the man who maintained his youthful good will toward
his countrymen, ordered them to cut off Nicanor's head and arm and
carry them to Jerusalem.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And when he arrived there and had called his countrymen together
and stationed the priests before the altar, he sent for those who were
in the citadel.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He showed them the vile Nicanor's head and that profane man's arm,
which had been boastfully stretched out against the holy house of the
Almighty;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` and he cut out the tongue of the ungodly Nicanor and said that he
would give it piecemeal to the birds and hang up these rewards of his
folly opposite the sanctuary.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And they all, looking to heaven, blessed the Lord who had
manifested himself, saying, "Blessed is he who has kept his own place
undefiled."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And he hung Nicanor's head from the citadel, a clear and
conspicuous sign to every one of the help of the Lord.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And they all decreed by public vote never to let this day go
unobserved, but to celebrate the thirteenth day of the twelfth month --
which is called Adar in the Syrian language -- the day before
Mordecai's day.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` This, then, is how matters turned out with Nicanor. And from that
time the city has been in the possession of the Hebrews. So I too will
here end my story.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` If it is well told and to the point, that is what I myself desired;
if it is poorly done and mediocre, that was the best I could do.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` For just as it is harmful to drink wine alone, or, again, to drink
water alone, while wine mixed with water is sweet and delicious and
enhances one's enjoyment, so also the style of the story delights the
ears of those who read the work. And here will be the end.
