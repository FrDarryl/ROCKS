"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the
Amal'ekites had made a raid upon the Negeb and upon Ziklag. They had
overcome Ziklag, and burned it with fire,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and
great; they killed no one, but carried them off, and went their way.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And when David and his men came to the city, they found it burned
with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and
wept, until they had no more strength to weep.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` David's two wives also had been taken captive, Ahin'o-am of Jezreel,
and Ab'igail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning
him, because all the people were bitter in soul, each for his sons and
daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And David said to Abi'athar the priest, the son of Ahim'elech,
"Bring me the ephod." So Abi'athar brought the ephod to David.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue after this band?
Shall I overtake them?" He answered him, "Pursue; for you shall surely
overtake and shall surely rescue."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So David set out, and the six hundred men who were with him, and
they came to the brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But David went on with the pursuit, he and four hundred men; two
hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` They found an Egyptian in the open country, and brought him to
David; and they gave him bread and he ate, they gave him water to
drink,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of
raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit revived; for he had not
eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And David said to him, "To whom do you belong? And where are you
from?" He said, "I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amal'ekite;
and my master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` We had made a raid upon the Negeb of the Cher'ethites and upon that
which belongs to Judah and upon the Negeb of Caleb; and we burned
Ziklag with fire."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And David said to him, "Will you take me down to this band?" And he
said, "Swear to me by God, that you will not kill me, or deliver me
into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this band."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And when he had taken him down, behold, they were spread abroad
over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the
great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from
the land of Judah.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And David smote them from twilight until the evening of the next
day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who
mounted camels and fled.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` David recovered all that the Amal'ekites had taken; and David
rescued his two wives.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters,
spoil or anything that had been taken; David brought back all.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` David also captured all the flocks and herds; and the people drove
those cattle before him, and said, "This is David's spoil."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then David came to the two hundred men, who had been too exhausted
to follow David, and who had been left at the brook Besor; and they
went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him; and
when David drew near to the people he saluted them.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then all the wicked and base fellows among the men who had gone
with David said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give
them any of the spoil which we have recovered, except that each man may
lead away his wife and children, and depart."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But David said, "You shall not do so, my brothers, with what the
LORD has given us; he has preserved us and given into our hand the band
that came against us.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Who would listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who
goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the
baggage; they shall share alike."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And from that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for
Israel to this day.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to his
friends, the elders of Judah, saying, "Here is a present for you from
the spoil of the enemies of the LORD";
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` it was for those in Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negeb, in Jattir,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` in Aro'er, in Siphmoth, in Eshtemo'a,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` in Racal, in the cities of the Jerah'meelites, in the cities of the
Ken'ites,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` in Hormah, in Borash'an, in A'thach,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` in Hebron, for all the places where David and his men had roamed.

Notas de rodap√©:
30:1-3 - When David returns to Ziklag, he discovers that the city has
been sacked by the Amalekites, and their families have been taken
captive. This highlights the vulnerability of David and his men and the
devastating impact war can have on families (see also Deuteronomy
30:4-6 - David and his men mourn deeply, but while the people talk of
stoning him, David draws strength from the Lord. David's dependence on
God in times of crisis is an example of faith and spiritual leadership
30:7-8 - David inquires of the Lord through the priest Abiathar, asking
whether he should pursue the Amalekites. God responds with a promise of
success. This moment demonstrates the importance of seeking divine
30:9-10 - David continues with 600 men, but 200 are left behind because
they are exhausted. Even in the face of difficulties, David continues
his mission with a smaller group, trusting in God's promise (see also
30:16-20 - David defeats the Amalekites and recovers everything that
was taken, including their families. David's victory is not only a
personal restoration, but also demonstrates God's faithfulness in
17:8-16).
