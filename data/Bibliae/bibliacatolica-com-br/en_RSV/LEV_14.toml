"1" = ''':sup:`1` The LORD said to Moses,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "This shall be the law of the leper for the day of his cleansing. He
shall be brought to the priest;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall make
an examination. Then, if the leprous disease is healed in the leper,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed
two living clean birds and cedarwood and scarlet stuff and hyssop;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an
earthen vessel over running water.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He shall take the living bird with the cedarwood and the scarlet
stuff and the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of
the bird that was killed over the running water;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and he shall sprinkle it seven times upon him who is to be cleansed
of leprosy; then he shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living
bird go into the open field.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off
all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean; and
after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his
tent seven days.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And on the seventh day he shall shave all his hair off his head; he
shall shave off his beard and his eyebrows, all his hair. Then he shall
wash his clothes, and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` "And on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without
blemish, and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and a cereal
offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and
one log of oil.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to be
cleansed and these things before the LORD, at the door of the tent of
meeting.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the priest shall take one of the male lambs, and offer it for a
guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them for a wave
offering before the LORD;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and he shall kill the lamb in the place where they kill the sin
offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place; for the guilt
offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most
holy.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering, and
the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be
cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of
his right foot.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into
the palm of his own left hand,

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and
sprinkle some oil with his finger seven times before the LORD.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` And some of the oil that remains in his hand the priest shall put
on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the
thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot, upon
the blood of the guilt offering;

"18" = ''':sup:`18` and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put
on the head of him who is to be cleansed. Then the priest shall make
atonement for him before the LORD.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` The priest shall offer the sin offering, to make atonement for him
who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill
the burnt offering;

"20" = ''':sup:`20` and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the cereal
offering on the altar. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him,
and he shall be clean.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` "But if he is poor and cannot afford so much, then he shall take
one male lamb for a guilt offering to be waved, to make atonement for
him, and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a cereal
offering, and a log of oil;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` also two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he can afford;
the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` And on the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to the
priest, to the door of the tent of meeting, before the LORD;

"24" = ''':sup:`24` and the priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering, and the
log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before
the LORD.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` and the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand on the
tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of
his right hand, and the great toe of his right foot, in the place where
the blood of the guilt offering was put;

"29" = ''':sup:`29` and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put
on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him
before the LORD.

"30" = ''':sup:`30` And he shall offer, of the turtledoves or young pigeons such as he
can afford,

"31" = ''':sup:`31` one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, along
with a cereal offering; and the priest shall make atonement before the
LORD for him who is being cleansed.

afford the offerings for his cleansing."

"34" = ''':sup:`34` "When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a
possession, and I put a leprous disease in a house in the land of your
possession,

"35" = ''':sup:`35` then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, `There
seems to me to be some sort of disease in my house.'
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the
priest goes to examine the disease, lest all that is in the house be
declared unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the
house.

"37" = ''':sup:`37` And he shall examine the disease; and if the disease is in the
walls of the house with greenish or reddish spots, and if it appears to
be deeper than the surface,

"38" = ''':sup:`38` then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house,
and shut up the house seven days.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And the priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look; and
if the disease has spread in the walls of the house,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in
which is the disease and throw them into an unclean place outside the
city;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped round
about, and the plaster that they scrape off they shall pour into an
unclean place outside the city;

"42" = ''':sup:`42` then they shall take other stones and put them in the place of
those stones, and he shall take other plaster and plaster the house.

"43" = ''':sup:`43` "If the disease breaks out again in the house, after he has taken
out the stones and scraped the house and plastered it,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` then the priest shall go and look; and if the disease has spread in
the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And he shall break down the house, its stones and timber and all
the plaster of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city
to an unclean place.

"46" = ''':sup:`46` Moreover he who enters the house while it is shut up shall be
unclean until the evening;

"47" = ''':sup:`47` and he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he
who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.

has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the
priest shall pronounce the house clean, for the disease is healed.

field; so he shall make atonement for the house, and it shall be
clean."
