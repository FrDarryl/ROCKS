"2" = ''':sup:`2` "This shall be the law of the leper for the day of his cleansing. He
shall be brought to the priest;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and the priest shall go out of the camp, and the priest shall make
an examination. Then, if the leprous disease is healed in the leper,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` the priest shall command them to take for him who is to be cleansed
two living clean birds and cedarwood and scarlet stuff and hyssop;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and the priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an
earthen vessel over running water.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` He shall take the living bird with the cedarwood and the scarlet
stuff and the hyssop, and dip them and the living bird in the blood of
the bird that was killed over the running water;

of leprosy; then he shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living
bird go into the open field.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off
all his hair, and bathe himself in water, and he shall be clean; and
after that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell outside his
tent seven days.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And on the seventh day he shall shave all his hair off his head; he
shall shave off his beard and his eyebrows, all his hair. Then he shall
wash his clothes, and bathe his body in water, and he shall be clean.

the blood of the guilt offering;

who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness. And afterward he shall kill
the burnt offering;

him, and a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a cereal
offering, and a log of oil;

"22" = ''':sup:`22` also two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he can afford;
the one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.

priest, to the door of the tent of meeting, before the LORD;

log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before
the LORD.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` and the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put
on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement for him
before the LORD.

seems to me to be some sort of disease in my house.'

"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the
priest goes to examine the disease, lest all that is in the house be
declared unclean; and afterward the priest shall go in to see the
house.

"37" = ''':sup:`37` And he shall examine the disease; and if the disease is in the
walls of the house with greenish or reddish spots, and if it appears to
be deeper than the surface,

and shut up the house seven days.

"39" = ''':sup:`39` And the priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look; and
if the disease has spread in the walls of the house,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in
which is the disease and throw them into an unclean place outside the
city;

"41" = ''':sup:`41` and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped round
about, and the plaster that they scrape off they shall pour into an
unclean place outside the city;

out the stones and scraped the house and plastered it,

"44" = ''':sup:`44` then the priest shall go and look; and if the disease has spread in
the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house; it is unclean.

"45" = ''':sup:`45` And he shall break down the house, its stones and timber and all
the plaster of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city
to an unclean place.
