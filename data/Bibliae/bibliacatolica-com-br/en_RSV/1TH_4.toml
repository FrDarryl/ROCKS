"2" = ''':sup:`2` For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain
from unchastity;

"4" = ''':sup:`4` that each one of you know how to take a wife for himself in holiness
and honor,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` not in the passion of lust like heathen who do not know God;
