"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an
earthly sanctuary.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For a tent was prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand
and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy
Place.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant
covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden urn holding
the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of
these things we cannot now speak in detail.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` These preparations having thus been made, the priests go continually
into the outer tent, performing their ritual duties;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a
year, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for
the errors of the people.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary is
not yet opened as long as the outer tent is still standing
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` (which is symbolic for the present age). According to this
arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot perfect the
conscience of the worshiper,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` but deal only with food and drink and various ablutions,
regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that
have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made
with hands, that is, not of this creation)
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` he entered once for all into the Holy Place, taking not the blood
of goats and calves but his own blood, thus securing an eternal
redemption.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats
and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the
purification of the flesh,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your conscience
from dead works to serve the living God.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who
are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death
has occurred which redeems them from the transgressions under the first
covenant.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must
be established.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as
long as the one who made it is alive.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Hence even the first covenant was not ratified without blood.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to
all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and
scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the
people,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded
you."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and
all the vessels used in worship.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and
without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be
purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with
better sacrifices than these.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For Christ has entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a
copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the
presence of God on our behalf.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters
the Holy Place yearly with blood not his own;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the
foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at
the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that
comes judgment,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will
appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are
eagerly waiting for him.

9:1-5 - The author of Hebrews describes the tabernacle and sacred
furnishings, highlighting the importance of ritual and worship in the
Old Testament. This symbolic system prepares the way for Christ's
