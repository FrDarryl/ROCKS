priests sounded trumpets; and all Israel stood.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was before the

locust to devour the land, or send pestilence among my people,

and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear

your father, saying, `There shall not fail you a man to rule Israel.'

"19" = ''':sup:`19` "But if you turn aside and forsake my statutes and my commandments
which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship
them,

"20" = ''':sup:`20` then I will pluck you up from the land which I have given you; and
this house, which I have consecrated for my name, I will cast out of my
sight, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.

astonished, and say, `Why has the LORD done thus to this land and to
this house?"

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then they will say, `Because they forsook the LORD the God of their
fathers who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on
other gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore he has
brought all this evil upon them'"
