"1" = ''':sup:`1` When this agreement had been reached, Lysias returned to the king,
and the Jews went about their farming.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But some of the governors in various places, Timothy and Apollonius
the son of Gennaeus, as well as Hieronymus and Demophon, and in
addition to these Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not let them
live quietly and in peace.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And some men of Joppa did so ungodly a deed as this: they invited
the Jews who lived among them to embark, with their wives and children,
on boats which they had provided, as though there were no ill will to
the Jews;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and this was done by public vote of the city. And when they
accepted, because they wished to live peaceably and suspected nothing,
the men of Joppa took them out to sea and drowned them, not less than
two hundred.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When Judas heard of the cruelty visited on his countrymen, he gave
orders to his men
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and, calling upon God the righteous Judge, attacked the murderers of
his brethren. He set fire to the harbor by night, and burned the boats,
and massacred those who had taken refuge there.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then, because the city's gates were closed, he withdrew, intending
to come again and root out the whole community of Joppa.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But learning that the men in Jamnia meant in the same way to wipe
out the Jews who were living among them,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` he attacked the people of Jamnia by night and set fire to the harbor
and the fleet, so that the glow of the light was seen in Jerusalem,
thirty miles distant.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When they had gone more than a mile from there, on their march
against Timothy, not less than five thousand Arabs with five hundred
horsemen attacked them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` After a hard fight Judas and his men won the victory, by the help
of God. The defeated nomads besought Judas to grant them pledges of
friendship, promising to give him cattle and to help his people in all
other ways.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Judas, thinking that they might really be useful in many ways,
agreed to make peace with them; and after receiving his pledges they
departed to their tents.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He also attacked a certain city which was strongly fortified with
earthworks and walls, and inhabited by all sorts of Gentiles. Its name
was Caspin.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And those who were within, relying on the strength of the walls and
on their supply of provisions, behaved most insolently toward Judas and
his men, railing at them and even blaspheming and saying unholy things.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But Judas and his men, calling upon the great Sovereign of the
world, who without battering-rams or engines of war overthrew Jericho
in the days of Joshua, rushed furiously upon the walls.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` They took the city by the will of God, and slaughtered untold
numbers, so that the adjoining lake, a quarter of a mile wide, appeared
to be running over with blood.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` When they had gone ninety-five miles from there, they came to
Charax, to the Jews who are called Toubiani.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` They did not find Timothy in that region, for he had by then
departed from the region without accomplishing anything, though in one
place he had left a very strong garrison.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Dositheus and Sosipater, who were captains under Maccabeus, marched
out and destroyed those whom Timothy had left in the stronghold, more
than ten thousand men.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Maccabeus arranged his army in divisions, set men in command of
the divisions, and hastened after Timothy, who had with him a hundred
and twenty thousand infantry and two thousand five hundred cavalry.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When Timothy learned of the approach of Judas, he sent off the
women and the children and also the baggage to a place called Carnaim;
for that place was hard to besiege and difficult of access because of
the narrowness of all the approaches.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But when Judas' first division appeared, terror and fear came over
the enemy at the manifestation to them of him who sees all things; and
they rushed off in flight and were swept on, this way and that, so that
often they were injured by their own men and pierced by the points of
their swords.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And Judas pressed the pursuit with the utmost vigor, putting the
sinners to the sword, and destroyed as many as thirty thousand men.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Timothy himself fell into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater and
their men. With great guile he besought them to let him go in safety,
because he held the parents of most of them and the brothers of some
and no consideration would be shown them.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And when with many words he had confirmed his solemn promise to
restore them unharmed, they let him go, for the sake of saving their
brethren.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then Judas marched against Carnaim and the temple of Atargatis, and
slaughtered twenty-five thousand people.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` After the rout and destruction of these, he marched also against
Ephron, a fortified city where Lysias dwelt with multitudes of people
of all nationalities. Stalwart young men took their stand before the
walls and made a vigorous defense; and great stores of war engines and
missiles were there.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But the Jews called upon the Sovereign who with power shatters the
might of his enemies, and they got the city into their hands, and
killed as many as twenty-five thousand of those who were within it.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Setting out from there, they hastened to Scythopolis, which is
seventy-five miles from Jerusalem.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But when the Jews who dwelt there bore witness to the good will
which the people of Scythopolis had shown them and their kind treatment
of them in times of misfortune,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` they thanked them and exhorted them to be well disposed to their
race in the future also. Then they went up to Jerusalem, as the feast
of weeks was close at hand.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` After the feast called Pentecost, they hastened against Gorgias,
the governor of Idumea.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And he came out with three thousand infantry and four hundred
cavalry.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` When they joined battle, it happened that a few of the Jews fell.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` But a certain Dositheus, one of Bacenor's men, who was on horseback
and was a strong man, caught hold of Gorgias, and grasping his cloak
was dragging him off by main strength, wishing to take the accursed man
alive, when one of the Thracian horsemen bore down upon him and cut off
his arm; so Gorgias escaped and reached Marisa.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` As Esdris and his men had been fighting for a long time and were
weary, Judas called upon the Lord to show himself their ally and leader
in the battle.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` In the language of their fathers he raised the battle cry, with
hymns; then he charged against Gorgias' men when they were not
expecting it, and put them to flight.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Then Judas assembled his army and went to the city of Adullam. As
the seventh day was coming on, they purified themselves according to
the custom, and they kept the sabbath there.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` On the next day, as by that time it had become necessary, Judas and
his men went to take up the bodies of the fallen and to bring them back
to lie with their kinsmen in the sepulchres of their fathers.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Then under the tunic of every one of the dead they found sacred
tokens of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear.
And it became clear to all that this was why these men had fallen.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` So they all blessed the ways of the Lord, the righteous Judge, who
reveals the things that are hidden;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and they turned to prayer, beseeching that the sin which had been
committed might be wholly blotted out. And the noble Judas exhorted the
people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their
own eyes what had happened because of the sin of those who had fallen.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` He also took up a collection, man by man, to the amount of two
thousand drachmas of silver, and sent it to Jerusalem to provide for a
sin offering. In doing this he acted very well and honorably, taking
account of the resurrection.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise
again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` But if he was looking to the splendid reward that is laid up for
those who fall asleep in godliness, it was a holy and pious thought.
Therefore he made atonement for the dead, that they might be delivered
from their sin.
