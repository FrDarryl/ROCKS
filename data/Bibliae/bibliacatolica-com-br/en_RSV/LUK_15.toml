him.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, "This man
receives sinners and eats with them."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So he told them this parable:
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` "What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of
them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after
the one which is lost, until he finds it?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his
neighbors, saying to them, `Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep
which was lost.'

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one
sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no
repentance.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` "Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does
not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and
neighbors, saying, `Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I
had lost.'

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one
sinner who repents."

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And he said, "There was a man who had two sons;

"12" = ''':sup:`12` and the younger of them said to his father, `Father, give me the
share of property that falls to me.' And he divided his living between
them.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took
his journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in
loose living.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when he had spent everything, a great famine arose in that
country, and he began to be in want.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that
country, who sent him into his fields to feed swine.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he would gladly have fed on the pods that the swine ate; and no
one gave him anything.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But when he came to himself he said, `How many of my father's hired
servants have bread enough and to spare, but I perish here with hunger!
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I
have sinned against heaven and before you;

"19" = ''':sup:`19` I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of
your hired servants."'

"20" = ''':sup:`20` And he arose and came to his father. But while he was yet at a
distance, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and embraced
him and kissed him.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the son said to him, `Father, I have sinned against heaven and
before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'

"22" = ''':sup:`22` But the father said to his servants, `Bring quickly the best robe,
and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet;

"23" = ''':sup:`23` and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make
merry;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is
found.' And they began to make merry.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` "Now his elder son was in the field; and as he came and drew near
to the house, he heard music and dancing.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And he called one of the servants and asked what this meant.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And he said to him, `Your brother has come, and your father has
killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and
entreated him,

"29" = ''':sup:`29` but he answered his father, `Lo, these many years I have served
you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a kid,
that I might make merry with my friends.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with
harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf!'
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And he said to him, `Son, you are always with me, and all that is
mine is yours.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` It was fitting to make merry and be glad, for this your brother was
dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'"
