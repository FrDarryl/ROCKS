month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before
me, the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then I beheld, and, lo, a form that had the appearance of a man;
below what appeared to be his loins it was fire, and above his loins it
was like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming bronze.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head;
and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in
visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the
inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of
jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the
vision that I saw in the plain.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then he said to me, "Son of man, lift up your eyes now in the
direction of the north." So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and
behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of
jealousy.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the
great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to
drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater
abominations."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked,
behold, there was a hole in the wall.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then said he to me, "Son of man, dig in the wall"; and when I dug in
the wall, lo, there was a door.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he said to me, "Go in, and see the vile abominations that they
are committing here."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So I went in and saw; and there, portrayed upon the wall round
about, were all kinds of creeping things, and loathsome beasts, and all
the idols of the house of Israel.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of
Israel, with Ja-azani'ah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each
had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went
up.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of
the house of Israel are doing in the dark, every man in his room of
pictures? For they say, `The LORD does not see us, the LORD has
forsaken the land.'"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He said also to me, "You will see still greater abominations which
they commit."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house
of the LORD; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see
still greater abominations than these."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD;
and behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch
and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the
temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun
toward the east.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too
slight a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which
they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence, and
provoke me further to anger? Lo, they put the branch to their nose.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Therefore I will deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I
have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not
hear them."
