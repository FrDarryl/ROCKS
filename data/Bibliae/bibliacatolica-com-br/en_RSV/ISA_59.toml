"2" = ''':sup:`2` but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God,
and your sins have hid his face from you so that he does not hear.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with
iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` No one enters suit justly, no one goes to law honestly; they rely on
empty pleas, they speak lies, they conceive mischief and bring forth
iniquity.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` They hatch adders' eggs, they weave the spider's web; he who eats
their eggs dies, and from one which is crushed a viper is hatched.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Their webs will not serve as clothing; men will not cover themselves
with what they make. Their works are works of iniquity, and deeds of
violence are in their hands.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood;
their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, desolation and destruction are
in their highways.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The way of peace they know not, and there is no justice in their
paths; they have made their roads crooked, no one who goes in them
knows peace.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Therefore justice is far from us, and righteousness does not
overtake us; we look for light, and behold, darkness, and for
brightness, but we walk in gloom.

no eyes; we stumble at noon as in the twilight, among those in full
vigor we are like dead men.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` We all growl like bears, we moan and moan like doves; we look for
justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far from us.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins
testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and we know our
iniquities:
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` transgressing, and denying the LORD, and turning away from
following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and
uttering from the heart lying words.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Justice is turned back, and righteousness stands afar off; for
truth has fallen in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a
prey. The LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no one to
intervene; then his own arm brought him victory, and his righteousness
upheld him.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation
upon his head; he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and
wrapped himself in fury as a mantle.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` According to their deeds, so will he repay, wrath to his
adversaries, requital to his enemies; to the coastlands he will render
requital.

glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come like a rushing
stream, which the wind of the LORD drives.

from transgression, says the LORD.

spirit which is upon you, and my words which I have put in your mouth,
shall not depart out of your mouth, or out of the mouth of your
children, or out of the mouth of your children's children, says the
LORD, from this time forth and for evermore."
