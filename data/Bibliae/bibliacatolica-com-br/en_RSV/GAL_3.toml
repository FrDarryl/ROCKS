"1" = ''':sup:`1` O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus
Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the
law, or by hearing with faith?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now ending
with the flesh?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Did you experience so many things in vain? -- if it really is in
vain.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you
do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Thus Abraham "believed God, and it was reckoned to him as
righteousness."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So you see that it is men of faith who are the sons of Abraham.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by
faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you shall
all the nations be blessed."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So then, those who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had
faith.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is
written, "Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written
in the book of the law, and do them."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law;
for "He who through faith is righteous shall live";
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` but the law does not rest on faith, for "He who does them shall
live by them."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse
for us -- for it is written, "Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree"
--
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come upon the
Gentiles, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through
faith.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` To give a human example, brethren: no one annuls even a man's will,
or adds to it, once it has been ratified.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does
not say, "And to offsprings," referring to many; but, referring to one,
"And to your offspring," which is Christ.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This is what I mean: the law, which came four hundred and thirty
years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God,
so as to make the promise void.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For if the inheritance is by the law, it is no longer by promise;
but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the
offspring should come to whom the promise had been made; and it was
ordained by angels through an intermediary.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now an intermediary implies more than one; but God is one.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not; for if
a law had been given which could make alive, then righteousness would
indeed be by the law.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But the scripture consigned all things to sin, that what was
promised to faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now before faith came, we were confined under the law, kept under
restraint until faith should be revealed.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So that the law was our custodian until Christ came, that we might
be justified by faith.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free,
there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs
according to promise.
