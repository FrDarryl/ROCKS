the graves of their dead, they reached another foolish decision, and
pursued as fugitives those whom they had begged and compelled to
depart.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For the fate they deserved drew them on to this end, and made them
forget what had happened, in order that they might fill up the
punishment which their torments still lacked,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and that thy people might experience an incredible journey, but they
themselves might meet a strange death.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For the whole creation in its nature was fashioned anew, complying
with thy commands, that thy children might be kept unharmed.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` The cloud was seen overshadowing the camp, and dry land emerging
where water had stood before, an unhindered way out of the Red Sea, and
a grassy plain out of the raging waves,

after gazing on marvelous wonders.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` For they ranged like horses, and leaped like lambs, praising thee, O
Lord, who didst deliver them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For they still recalled the events of their sojourn, how instead of

'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The punishments did not come upon the sinners without prior signs
in the violence of thunder, for they justly suffered because of their
wicked acts; for they practiced a more bitter hatred of strangers.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Others had refused to receive strangers when they came to them, but
these made slaves of guests who were their benefactors.

people; and thou hast not neglected to help them at all times and in
all places.
