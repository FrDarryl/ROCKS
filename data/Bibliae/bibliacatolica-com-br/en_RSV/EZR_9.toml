Jeb'usites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the
Amorites.

themselves and for their sons; so that the holy race has mixed itself
with the peoples of the lands. And in this faithlessness the hand of
the officials and chief men has been foremost."

from my head and beard, and sat appalled.

the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered round me while I sat
appalled until the evening sacrifice.

garments and my mantle rent, and fell upon my knees and spread out my
hands to the LORD my God,

my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our

guilt; and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been

reviving in our bondage.

great guilt, seeing that thou, our God, hast punished us less than our
iniquities deserved and hast given us such a remnant as this,
