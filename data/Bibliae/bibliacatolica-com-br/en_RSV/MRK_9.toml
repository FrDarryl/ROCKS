"1" = ''':sup:`1` And he said to them, "Truly, I say to you, there are some standing
here who will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God
has come with power."
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and
led them up a high mountain apart by themselves; and he was
transfigured before them,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and his garments became glistening, intensely white, as no fuller on
earth could bleach them.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And there appeared to them Eli'jah with Moses; and they were talking
to Jesus.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is well that we are here; let
us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for
Eli'jah."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For he did not know what to say, for they were exceedingly afraid.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud,
"This is my beloved Son; listen to him."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And suddenly looking around they no longer saw any one with them but
Jesus only.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell
no one what they had seen, until the Son of man should have risen from
the dead.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what the rising
from the dead meant.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And they asked him, "Why do the scribes say that first Eli'jah must
come?"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he said to them, "Eli'jah does come first to restore all
things; and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer
many things and be treated with contempt?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But I tell you that Eli'jah has come, and they did to him whatever
they pleased, as it is written of him."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd about
them, and scribes arguing with them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly
amazed, and ran up to him and greeted him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he asked them, "What are you discussing with them?"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And one of the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to
you, for he has a dumb spirit;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he foams and
grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast
it out, and they were not able."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he answered them, "O faithless generation, how long am I to be
with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And they brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him,
immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled
about, foaming at the mouth.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And Jesus asked his father, "How long has he had this?" And he
said, "From childhood.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And it has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to
destroy him; but if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And Jesus said to him, "If you can! All things are possible to him
who believes."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe;
help my unbelief!"
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked
the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You dumb and deaf spirit, I command
you, come out of him, and never enter him again."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and
the boy was like a corpse; so that most of them said, "He is dead."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him
privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And he said to them, "This kind cannot be driven out by anything
but prayer."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he would
not have any one know it;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, "The Son of man
will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and
when he is killed, after three days he will rise."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask
him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And they came to Caper'na-um; and when he was in the house he asked
them, "What were you discussing on the way?"
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one
another who was the greatest.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them, "If any
one would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And he took a child, and put him in the midst of them; and taking
him in his arms, he said to them,
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me; and
whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me."
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` John said to him, "Teacher, we saw a man casting out demons in your
name, and we forbade him, because he was not following us."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` But Jesus said, "Do not forbid him; for no one who does a mighty
work in my name will be able soon after to speak evil of me.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` For he that is not against us is for us.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink
because you bear the name of Christ, will by no means lose his reward.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` "Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin,
it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung round his
neck and he were thrown into the sea.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for
you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go to hell, to the
unquenchable fire.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off; it is better for
you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out; it is better for
you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be
thrown into hell,

"48" = ''':sup:`48` where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` For every one will be salted with fire.

"50" = ''':sup:`50` Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its saltness, how will you
season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."
