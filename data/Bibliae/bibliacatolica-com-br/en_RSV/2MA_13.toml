"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the one hundred and forty-ninth year word came to Judas and his
men that Antiochus Eupator was coming with a great army against Judea,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and with him Lysias, his guardian, who had charge of the government.
Each of them had a Greek force of one hundred and ten thousand
infantry, five thousand three hundred cavalry, twenty-two elephants,
and three hundred chariots armed with scythes.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Menelaus also joined them and with utter hypocrisy urged Antiochus
on, not for the sake of his country's welfare, but because he thought
that he would be established in office.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the King of kings aroused the anger of Antiochus against the
scoundrel; and when Lysias informed him that this man was to blame for
all the trouble, he ordered them to take him to Beroea and to put him
to death by the method which is the custom in that place.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For there is a tower in that place, fifty cubits high, full of
ashes, and it has a rim running around it which on all sides inclines
precipitously into the ashes.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` There they all push to destruction any man guilty of sacrilege or
notorious for other crimes.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` By such a fate it came about that Menelaus the lawbreaker died,
without even burial in the earth.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And this was eminently just; because he had committed many sins
against the altar whose fire and ashes were holy, he met his death in
ashes.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` The king with barbarous arrogance was coming to show the Jews things
far worse than those that had been done in his father's time.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But when Judas heard of this, he ordered the people to call upon
the Lord day and night, now if ever to help those who were on the point
of being deprived of the law and their country and the holy temple,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and not to let the people who had just begun to revive fall into
the hands of the blasphemous Gentiles.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When they had all joined in the same petition and had besought the
merciful Lord with weeping and fasting and lying prostrate for three
days without ceasing, Judas exhorted them and ordered them to stand
ready.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` After consulting privately with the elders, he determined to march
out and decide the matter by the help of God before the king's army
could enter Judea and get possession of the city.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So, committing the decision to the Creator of the world and
exhorting his men to fight nobly to the death for the laws, temple,
city, country, and commonwealth, he pitched his camp near Modein.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He gave his men the watchword, "God's victory," and with a picked
force of the bravest young men, he attacked the king's pavilion at
night and slew as many as two thousand men in the camp. He stabbed the
leading elephant and its rider.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` In the end they filled the camp with terror and confusion and
withdrew in triumph.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` This happened, just as day was dawning, because the Lord's help
protected him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` The king, having had a taste of the daring of the Jews, tried
strategy in attacking their positions.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He advanced against Beth-zur, a strong fortress of the Jews, was
turned back, attacked again, and was defeated.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Judas sent in to the garrison whatever was necessary.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But Rhodocus, a man from the ranks of the Jews, gave secret
information to the enemy; he was sought for, caught, and put in prison.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The king negotiated a second time with the people in Beth-zur, gave
pledges, received theirs, withdrew, attacked Judas and his men, was
defeated;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` he got word that Philip, who had been left in charge of the
government, had revolted in Antioch; he was dismayed, called in the
Jews, yielded and swore to observe all their rights, settled with them
and offered sacrifice, honored the sanctuary and showed generosity to
the holy place.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` He received Maccabeus, left Hegemonides as governor from Ptolemais
to Gerar,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and went to Ptolemais. The people of Ptolemais were indignant over
the treaty; in fact they were so angry that they wanted to annul its
terms.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Lysias took the public platform, made the best possible defense,
convinced them, appeased them, gained their good will, and set out for
Antioch. This is how the king's attack and withdrawal turned out.
