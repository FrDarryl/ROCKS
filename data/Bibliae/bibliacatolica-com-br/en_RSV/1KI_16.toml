"1" = ''':sup:`1` And the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hana'ni against
Ba'asha, saying,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my
people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jerobo'am, and have
made my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` behold, I will utterly sweep away Ba'asha and his house, and I will
make your house like the house of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Any one belonging to Ba'asha who dies in the city the dogs shall
eat; and any one of his who dies in the field the birds of the air
shall eat."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now the rest of the acts of Ba'asha, and what he did, and his might,
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of
Israel?

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Ba'asha slept with his fathers, and was buried at Tirzah; and
Elah his son reigned in his stead.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Moreover the word of the LORD came by the prophet Jehu the son of
Hana'ni against Ba'asha and his house, both because of all the evil
that he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger with the
work of his hands, in being like the house of Jerobo'am, and also
because he destroyed it.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of
Ba'asha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and reigned two years.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired
against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house
of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah,

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the
twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his
throne, he killed all the house of Ba'asha; he did not leave him a
single male of his kinsmen or his friends.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Ba'asha, according to the
word of the LORD, which he spoke against Ba'asha by Jehu the prophet,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` for all the sins of Ba'asha and the sins of Elah his son which they
sinned, and which they made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD God of
Israel to anger with their idols.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not
written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned
seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gib'bethon,
which belonged to the Philistines,

"16" = ''':sup:`16` and the troops who were encamped heard it said, "Zimri has
conspired, and he has killed the king"; therefore all Israel made Omri,
the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Omri went up from Gib'bethon, and all Israel with him, and they
besieged Tirzah.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the
citadel of the king's house, and burned the king's house over him with
fire, and died,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` because of his sins which he committed, doing evil in the sight of
the LORD, walking in the way of Jerobo'am, and for his sin which he
committed, making Israel to sin.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy which he
made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings
of Israel?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts; half of the
people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half
followed Omri.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed
Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri became king.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign
over Israel, and reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in
Tirzah.

silver; and he fortified the hill, and called the name of the city
which he built, Sama'ria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the
hill.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did more evil
than all who were before him.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For he walked in all the way of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, and in
the sins which he made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD, the God of
Israel, to anger by their idols.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and the might that
he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the
Kings of Israel?

Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of
Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over
Israel in Sama'ria twenty-two years.

"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD more
than all that were before him.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of
Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, he took for wife Jez'ebel the daughter of
Ethba'al king of the Sido'nians, and went and served Ba'al, and
worshiped him.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` He erected an altar for Ba'al in the house of Ba'al, which he built
in Sama'ria.

Notas de rodap√©:
16:1-4 - The prophet Jehu announces the destruction of the house of
Baasha, king of Israel, because of their sins. The cycle of idolatry
and judgment continues, highlighting God's holiness and righteousness
(see also 1 Kings 15:29-30 and 2 Kings 9:7-10).
16:8-10 - Zimri conspires against Elah, Baasha's son, and kills him,
fulfilling the prophecy of judgment on the house of Baasha. The
violence and political instability in Israel reflect the turning away
16:11-14 - Zimri exterminates Baasha's entire family, fulfilling God's
word. However, Zimri's reign is brief, showing that rebellion against
God and the use of violence have consequences (see also 1 Kings
16:23-24 - Omri establishes Samaria as the new capital of Israel,
strengthening his political position. However, he continues in the sins
of Jeroboam, perpetuating the idolatry that separates the people from
16:29-33 - Ahab, son of Omri, becomes king and is described as the
worst king to date, for introducing the worship of Baal into Israel.
His union with Jezebel and the building of altars to Baal mark the
2:20).
