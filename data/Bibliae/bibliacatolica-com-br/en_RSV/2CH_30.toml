E'phraim and Manas'seh, that they should come to the house of the LORD
at Jerusalem, to keep the passover to the LORD the God of Israel.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` For the king and his princes and all the assembly in Jerusalem had
taken counsel to keep the passover in the second month --

"3" = ''':sup:`3` for they could not keep it in its time because the priests had not
sanctified themselves in sufficient number, nor had the people
assembled in Jerusalem --
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and the plan seemed right to the king and all the assembly.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from
Beer-sheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the passover to
the LORD the God of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not kept it in
great numbers as prescribed.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from
the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, "O people
of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the
hand of the kings of Assyria.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Do not be like your fathers and your brethren, who were faithless to
the LORD God of their fathers, so that he made them a desolation, as
you see.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Do not now be stiff-necked as your fathers were, but yield
yourselves to the LORD, and come to his sanctuary, which he has
sanctified for ever, and serve the LORD your God, that his fierce anger
may turn away from you.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` For if you return to the LORD, your brethren and your children will
find compassion with their captors, and return to this land. For the
LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face
from you, if you return to him."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So the couriers went from city to city through the country of
E'phraim and Manas'seh, and as far as Zeb'ulun; but they laughed them
to scorn, and mocked them.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Only a few men of Asher, of Manas'seh, and of Zeb'ulun humbled
themselves and came to Jerusalem.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one heart to do
what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the LORD.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the feast of
unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and
all the altars for burning incense they took away and threw into the
Kidron valley.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the
second month. And the priests and the Levites were put to shame, so
that they sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the
house of the LORD.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` They took their accustomed posts according to the law of Moses the
man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from
the hand of the Levites.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified
themselves; therefore the Levites had to kill the passover lamb for
every one who was not clean, to make it holy to the LORD.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For a multitude of the people, many of them from E'phraim,
Manas'seh, Is'sachar, and Zeb'ulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet
they ate the passover otherwise than as prescribed. For Hezeki'ah had
prayed for them, saying, "The good LORD pardon every one
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` who sets his heart to seek God, the LORD the God of his fathers,
even though not according to the sanctuary's rules of cleanness."

"20" = ''':sup:`20` And the LORD heard Hezeki'ah, and healed the people.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the people of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the
feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the
Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with all
their might to the LORD.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And Hezeki'ah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed
good skill in the service of the LORD. So the people ate the food of
the festival for seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving
thanks to the LORD the God of their fathers.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast for
another seven days; so they kept it for another seven days with
gladness.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For Hezeki'ah king of Judah gave the assembly a thousand bulls and
seven thousand sheep for offerings, and the princes gave the assembly a
thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. And the priests sanctified
themselves in great numbers.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` The whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, and
the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came
