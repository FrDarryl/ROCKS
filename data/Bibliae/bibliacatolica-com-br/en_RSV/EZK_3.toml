"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he said to me, "Son of man, eat this scroll that I give you and

"6" = ''':sup:`6` not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose
words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then the Spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the LORD arose
from its place, I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they
touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, that
sounded like a great earthquake.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness
in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me;

"15" = ''':sup:`15` and I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river

"17" = ''':sup:`17` "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel;

"18" = ''':sup:`18` If I say to the wicked, `You shall surely die,' and you give him no
warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to
save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood
I will require at your hand.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his
wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but
you will have saved your life.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Again, if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits
iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because
you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous
deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will

"Arise, go forth into the plain, and there I will speak with you."

"23" = ''':sup:`23` So I arose and went forth into the plain; and, lo, the glory of the
LORD stood there, like the glory which I had seen by the river Chebar;
and I fell on my face.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he
spoke with me and said to me, "Go, shut yourself within your house.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` And you, O son of man, behold, cords will be placed upon you, and
you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the
people;

"26" = ''':sup:`26` and I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, so
that you shall be dumb and unable to reprove them; for they are a
rebellious house.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall
say to them, `Thus says the Lord GOD'; he that will hear, let him hear;
