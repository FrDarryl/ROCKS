"4" = ''':sup:`4` I brought them to the house of the LORD into the chamber of the sons

Shallum, keeper of the threshold.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then I set before the Re'chabites pitchers full of wine, and cups;
and I said to them, "Drink wine."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But they answered, "We will drink no wine, for Jon'adab the son of
Rechab, our father, commanded us, `You shall not drink wine, neither
you nor your sons for ever;

"7" = ''':sup:`7` you shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not
plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days,

seed;

"11" = ''':sup:`11` But when Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon came up against the land,
we said, `Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:

"13" = ''':sup:`13` "Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the

instruction and listen to my words? says the LORD.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The command which Jon'adab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to
drink no wine, has been kept; and they drink none to this day, for they
have obeyed their father's command. I have spoken to you persistently,
but you have not listened to me.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them
persistently, saying, `Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and

But you did not incline your ear or listen to me.

Behold, I am bringing on Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all
the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to
them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have
not answered."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But to the house of the Re'chabites Jeremiah said, "Thus says the
LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command

"19" = ''':sup:`19` therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jon'adab
the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me."
