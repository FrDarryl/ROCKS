"2" = ''':sup:`2` Therefore thou dost correct little by little those who trespass, and
dost remind and warn them of the things wherein they sin, that they may
be freed from wickedness and put their trust in thee, O Lord.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Those who dwelt of old in thy holy land

"4" = ''':sup:`4` thou didst hate for their detestable practices, their works of
sorcery and unholy rites,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` their merciless slaughter of children, and their sacrificial
feasting on human flesh and blood. These initiates from the midst of a
heathen cult,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` these parents who murder helpless lives, thou didst will to destroy
by the hands of our fathers,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` that the land most precious of all to thee might receive a worthy
colony of the servants of God.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But even these thou didst spare, since they were but men, and didst
send wasps as forerunners of thy army, to destroy them little by
little,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` though thou wast not unable to give the ungodly into the hands of
the righteous in battle, or to destroy them at one blow by dread wild
beasts or thy stern word.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But judging them little by little thou gavest them a chance to
repent, though thou wast not unaware that their origin was evil and
their wickedness inborn, and that their way of thinking would never
change.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For they were an accursed race from the beginning, and it was not
through fear of any one that thou didst leave them unpunished for their
sins.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For who will say, "What hast thou done?" Or will resist thy
judgment? Who will accuse thee for the destruction of nations which
thou didst make? Or who will come before thee to plead as an advocate
for unrighteous men?
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For neither is there any god besides thee, whose care is for all
men, to whom thou shouldst prove that thou hast not judged unjustly;

"14" = ''':sup:`14` nor can any king or monarch confront thee about those whom thou
hast punished.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thou art righteous and rulest all things righteously, deeming it
alien to thy power to condemn him who does not deserve to be punished.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For thy strength is the source of righteousness, and thy
sovereignty over all causes thee to spare all.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` For thou dost show thy strength when men doubt the completeness of
thy power, and dost rebuke any insolence among those who know it.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Thou who art sovereign in strength dost judge with mildness, and
with great forbearance thou dost govern us; for thou hast power to act

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Through such works thou has taught thy people that the righteous
man must be kind, and thou hast filled thy sons with good hope, because
thou givest repentance for sins.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` For if thou didst punish with such great care and indulgence the
enemies of thy servants and those deserving of death, granting them
time and opportunity to give up their wickedness,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` with what strictness thou hast judged thy sons, to whose fathers
thou gavest oaths and covenants full of good promises!

"22" = ''':sup:`22` So while chastening us thou scourgest our enemies ten thousand
times more, so that we may meditate upon thy goodness when we judge,
and when we are judged we may expect mercy.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Therefore those who in folly of life lived unrighteously thou didst
torment through their own abominations.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For they went far astray on the paths of error, accepting as gods
those animals which even their enemies despised; they were deceived
like foolish babes.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Therefore, as to thoughtless children, thou didst send thy judgment
to mock them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But those who have not heeded the warning of light rebukes will
experience the deserved judgment of God.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For when in their suffering they became incensed at those creatures
which they had thought to be gods, being punished by means of them,
they saw and recognized as the true God him whom they had before
refused to know. Therefore the utmost condemnation came upon them.
