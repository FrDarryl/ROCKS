"11" = ''':sup:`11` And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their

Notas de rodap√©:
14:8-18 - Paul and Barnabas heal a crippled man, and the people of
Lystra attempt to worship them. This episode illustrates the human
tendency to idolize leadership figures, but also the importance of
14:19-23 - Paul is stoned and left for dead, but he rises and continues
his mission. This event illustrates the endurance needed to fulfill
14:24-28 - Paul and Barnabas return to Antioch, reporting all that God
has done and how they have opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
This demonstrates the advancement of the mission and God's faithfulness
15:18-19).
