"1" = ''':sup:`1` About that time, as it happened, Antiochus had retreated in disorder
from the region of Persia.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and attempted to rob
the temples and control the city. Therefore the people rushed to the
rescue with arms, and Antiochus and his men were defeated, with the
result that Antiochus was put to flight by the inhabitants and beat a
shameful retreat.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` While he was in Ecbatana, news came to him of what had happened to
Nicanor and the forces of Timothy.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Transported with rage, he conceived the idea of turning upon the
Jews the injury done by those who had put him to flight; so he ordered
his charioteer to drive without stopping until he completed the
journey. But the judgment of heaven rode with him! For in his arrogance
he said, "When I get there I will make Jerusalem a cemetery of Jews."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him an incurable
and unseen blow. As soon as he ceased speaking he was seized with a
pain in his bowels for which there was no relief and with sharp
internal tortures --
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and that very justly, for he had tortured the bowels of others with
many and strange inflictions.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Yet he did not in any way stop his insolence, but was even more
filled with arrogance, breathing fire in his rage against the Jews, and
giving orders to hasten the journey. And so it came about that he fell
out of his chariot as it was rushing along, and the fall was so hard as
to torture every limb of his body.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Thus he who had just been thinking that he could command the waves
of the sea, in his superhuman arrogance, and imagining that he could
weigh the high mountains in a balance, was brought down to earth and
carried in a litter, making the power of God manifest to all.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And so the ungodly man's body swarmed with worms, and while he was
still living in anguish and pain, his flesh rotted away, and because of
his stench the whole army felt revulsion at his decay.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Because of his intolerable stench no one was able to carry the man
who a little while before had thought that he could touch the stars of
heaven.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then it was that, broken in spirit, he began to lose much of his
arrogance and to come to his senses under the scourge of God, for he
was tortured with pain every moment.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And when he could not endure his own stench, he uttered these
words: "It is right to be subject to God, and no mortal should think
that he is equal to God."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then the abominable fellow made a vow to the Lord, who would no
longer have mercy on him, stating
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` that the holy city, which he was hastening to level to the ground
and to make a cemetery, he was now declaring to be free;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and the Jews, whom he had not considered worth burying but had
planned to throw out with their children to the beasts, for the birds
to pick, he would make, all of them, equal to citizens of Athens;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and the holy sanctuary, which he had formerly plundered, he would
adorn with the finest offerings; and the holy vessels he would give
back, all of them, many times over; and the expenses incurred for the
sacrifices he would provide from his own revenues;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and in addition to all this he also would become a Jew and would
visit every inhabited place to proclaim the power of God.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But when his sufferings did not in any way abate, for the judgment
of God had justly come upon him, he gave up all hope for himself and
wrote to the Jews the following letter, in the form of a supplication.
This was its content:
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` "To his worthy Jewish citizens, Antiochus their king and general
sends hearty greetings and good wishes for their health and prosperity.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` If you and your children are well and your affairs are as you wish,
I am glad. As my hope is in heaven,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I remember with affection your esteem and good will. On my way back
from the region of Persia I suffered an annoying illness, and I have
deemed it necessary to take thought for the general security of all.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` I do not despair of my condition, for I have good hope of
recovering from my illness,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` but I observed that my father, on the occasions when he made
expeditions into the upper country, appointed his successor,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` so that, if anything unexpected happened or any unwelcome news
came, the people throughout the realm would not be troubled, for they
would know to whom the government was left.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Moreover, I understand how the princes along the borders and the
neighbors to my kingdom keep watching for opportunities and waiting to
see what will happen. So I have appointed my son Antiochus to be king,
whom I have often entrusted and commended to most of you when I
hastened off to the upper provinces; and I have written to him what is
written here.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` I therefore urge and beseech you to remember the public and private
services rendered to you and to maintain your present good will, each
of you, toward me and my son.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For I am sure that he will follow my policy and will treat you with
moderation and kindness."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So the murderer and blasphemer, having endured the more intense
suffering, such as he had inflicted on others, came to the end of his
life by a most pitiable fate, among the mountains in a strange land.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And Philip, one of his courtiers, took his body home; then, fearing
the son of Antiochus, he betook himself to Ptolemy Philometor in Egypt.
