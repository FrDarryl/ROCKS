"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head,
and arrayed him in a purple robe;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` they came up to him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" and struck
him with their hands.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Pilate went out again, and said to them, "See, I am bringing him out
to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe.
Pilate said to them, "Behold the man!"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out,
"Crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Take him yourselves
and crucify him, for I find no crime in him."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law he ought to
die, because he has made himself the Son of God."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, "Where are you
from?" But Jesus gave no answer.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Pilate therefore said to him, "You will not speak to me? Do you not
know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Jesus answered him, "You would have no power over me unless it had
been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the
greater sin."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Upon this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, "If
you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend; every one who makes
himself a king sets himself against Caesar."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on
the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew,
Gab'batha.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the
sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They cried out, "Away with him, away with him, crucify him!" Pilate
said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered,
"We have no king but Caesar."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the
place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Gol'gotha.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either
side, and Jesus between them.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, "Jesus
of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was
crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin,
and in Greek.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, "Do not write,
`The King of the Jews,' but, `This man said, I am King of the Jews.'"
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Pilate answered, "What I have written I have written."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments and
made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic
was without seam, woven from top to bottom;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for
it to see whose it shall be." This was to fulfil the scripture, "They
parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of Jesus were
his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary
Mag'dalene.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing
near, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son!"
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that
hour the disciple took her to his own home.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` After this Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to
fulfil the scripture), "I thirst."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of
the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished"; and
he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies
from remaining on the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a high
day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that
they might be taken away.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the
other who had been crucified with him;
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they
did not break his legs.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once
there came out blood and water.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` He who saw it has borne witness -- his testimony is true, and he
knows that he tells the truth -- that you also may believe.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled,
"Not a bone of him shall be broken."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And again another scripture says, "They shall look on him whom they
have pierced."
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` After this Joseph of Arimathe'a, who was a disciple of Jesus, but
secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away
the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and took away
his body.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Nicode'mus also, who had at first come to him by night, came
bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds' weight.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` They took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the
spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in
the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was close
at hand, they laid Jesus there.

Notas de rodap√©:
19:1-3 - Jesus is scourged and mocked before His crucifixion,
fulfilling the prophecies of the Messiah's suffering. Christ's
suffering anticipates the sacrifice necessary for salvation,

cross, though a symbol of shame, becomes the greatest expression of

Jesus is "The King of the Jews." Despite the mockery, this inscription
