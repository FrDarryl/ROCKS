command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the people of
Israel.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Sham'mu-a the
son of Zaccur;

"5" = ''':sup:`5` from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;

"6" = ''':sup:`6` from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephun'neh;

'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the
land. And Moses called Hoshe'a the son of Nun Joshua.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them,
"Go up into the Negeb yonder, and go up into the hill country,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it
are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether
the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and whether the land is rich or poor, and whether there is wood in
it or not. Be of good courage, and bring some of the fruit of the
land." Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin
to Rehob, near the entrance of Hamath.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` They went up into the Negeb, and came to Hebron; and Ahi'man,
She'shai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there. (Hebron was
built seven years before Zo'an in Egypt.)
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And they came to the Valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a
branch with a single cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole
between two of them; they brought also some pomegranates and figs.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster
which the men of Israel cut down from there.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the
people of Israel in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh; they brought
back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the
fruit of the land.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And they told him, "We came to the land to which you sent us; it
flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Yet the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are
fortified and very large; and besides, we saw the descendants of Anak
there.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The Amal'ekites dwell in the land of the Negeb; the Hittites, the
Jeb'usites, and the Amorites dwell in the hill country; and the
Canaanites dwell by the sea, and along the Jordan."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, "Let us go up
at once, and occupy it; for we are well able to overcome it."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Then the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go
up against the people; for they are stronger than we."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So they brought to the people of Israel an evil report of the land
which they had spied out, saying, "The land, through which we have
gone, to spy it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants; and all
the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And there we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak, who come from the
Nephilim); and we seemed to ourselves like grasshoppers, and so we
seemed to them."

Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-3 - God commands Moses to send 12 spies to explore the land of
Canaan. This marks a time of preparation and confidence in the
fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to Israel (see also
13:17-20 - Moses instructs the spies to observe the land, its people,
and its cities. This investigation anticipates the entry into Canaan
and emphasizes the importance of wisdom and strategy in fulfilling
13:25-29 - The spies return with a positive report about the land's
fertility, but they express fear because of the strong inhabitants.
This demonstrates the tension between God's promise and human fear (see
13:30-31 - Caleb encourages the people to trust God and take possession
of the land, while the other spies discourage the people, demonstrating
a lack of faith. This passage illustrates the importance of trusting
Corinthians 5:7).
13:32-33 - The spies' unbelief creates fear among the Israelites,
distorting reality with exaggerations about giants in the land. This
shows how a lack of faith can lead to despair and disobedience (see
