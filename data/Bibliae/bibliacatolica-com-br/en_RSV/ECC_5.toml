God.

Notas de rodap√©:
5:1-2 - The author advises caution when speaking and making promises
before God. Words have power, and reverence when entering God's
presence is essential. God values sincerity in worship and prayer (see
5:4-5 - Keeping vows to God is a key principle. Breaking promises can
have spiritual consequences, demonstrating that it is better not to
promise than to promise and not fulfill (see also Deuteronomy 23:21 and
05:10 - The relentless pursuit of wealth never brings complete
satisfaction. The love of money can lead to an insatiable cycle of
desire, contrasting with the true joy that comes from God (see also
05:12 - Honest work brings peace, while accumulated wealth often brings
unrest and worry. This highlights the importance of being content with
4:11-12).
5:18-20 - The author concludes that true blessing lies in enjoying the
work and blessings God provides. Contentment in God is the key to a
128:2).
