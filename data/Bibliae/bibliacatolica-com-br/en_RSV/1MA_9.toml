"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Demetrius heard that Nicanor and his army had fallen in battle,
he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Judah a second time, and
with them the right wing of the army.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` They went by the road which leads to Gilgal and encamped against
Mesaloth in Arbela, and they took it and killed many people.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` In the first month of the one hundred and fifty-second year they
encamped against Jerusalem;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` then they marched off and went to Berea with twenty thousand foot
soldiers and two thousand cavalry.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Now Judas was encamped in Elasa, and with him were three thousand
picked men.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When they saw the huge number of the enemy forces, they were greatly
frightened, and many slipped away from the camp, until no more than
eight hundred of them were left.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Judas saw that his army had slipped away and the battle was
imminent, he was crushed in spirit, for he had no time to assemble
them.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He became faint, but he said to those who were left, "Let us rise
and go up against our enemies. We may be able to fight them."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But they tried to dissuade him, saying, "We are not able. Let us
rather save our own lives now, and let us come back with our brethren
and fight them; we are too few."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But Judas said, "Far be it from us to do such a thing as to flee
from them. If our time has come, let us die bravely for our brethren,
and leave no cause to question our honor."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then the army of Bacchides marched out from the camp and took its
stand for the encounter. The cavalry was divided into two companies,
and the slingers and the archers went ahead of the army, as did all the
chief warriors.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Bacchides was on the right wing. Flanked by the two companies, the
phalanx advanced to the sound of the trumpets; and the men with Judas
also blew their trumpets.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` The earth was shaken by the noise of the armies, and the battle
raged from morning till evening.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Judas saw that Bacchides and the strength of his army were on the
right; then all the stouthearted men went with him,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and they crushed the right wing, and he pursued them as far as
Mount Azotus.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When those on the left wing saw that the right wing was crushed,
they turned and followed close behind Judas and his men.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The battle became desperate, and many on both sides were wounded
and fell.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Judas also fell, and the rest fled.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother and buried him in
the tomb of their fathers at Modein,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and wept for him. And all Israel made great lamentation for him;
they mourned many days and said,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "How is the mighty fallen, the savior of Israel!"
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Now the rest of the acts of Judas, and his wars and the brave deeds
that he did, and his greatness, have not been recorded, for they were
very many.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` After the death of Judas, the lawless emerged in all parts of
Israel; all the doers of injustice appeared.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` In those days a very great famine occurred, and the country
deserted with them to the enemy.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And Bacchides chose the ungodly and put them in charge of the
country.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` They sought and searched for the friends of Judas, and brought them
to Bacchides, and he took vengeance on them and made sport of them.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Thus there was great distress in Israel, such as had not been since
the time that prophets ceased to appear among them.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then all the friends of Judas assembled and said to Jonathan,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` "Since the death of your brother Judas there has been no one like
him to go against our enemies and Bacchides, and to deal with those of
our nation who hate us.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So now we have chosen you today to take his place as our ruler and
leader, to fight our battle."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And Jonathan at that time accepted the leadership and took the
place of Judas his brother.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` When Bacchides learned of this, he tried to kill him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` But Jonathan and Simon his brother and all who were with him heard
of it, and they fled into the wilderness of Tekoa and camped by the
water of the pool of Asphar.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Bacchides found this out on the sabbath day, and he with all his
army crossed the Jordan.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And Jonathan sent his brother as leader of the multitude and begged
the Nabateans, who were his friends, for permission to store with them
the great amount of baggage which they had.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` But the sons of Jambri from Medeba came out and seized John and all
that he had, and departed with it.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` After these things it was reported to Jonathan and Simon his
brother, "The sons of Jambri are celebrating a great wedding, and are
conducting the bride, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Canaan,
from Nadabath with a large escort."
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And they remembered the blood of John their brother, and went up
and hid under cover of the mountain.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` They raised their eyes and looked, and saw a tumultuous procession
with much baggage; and the bridegroom came out with his friends and his
brothers to meet them with tambourines and musicians and many weapons.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Then they rushed upon them from the ambush and began killing them.
Many were wounded and fell, and the rest fled to the mountain; and they
took all their goods.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Thus the wedding was turned into mourning and the voice of their
musicians into a funeral dirge.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And when they had fully avenged the blood of their brother, they
returned to the marshes of the Jordan.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` When Bacchides heard of this, he came with a large force on the
sabbath day to the banks of the Jordan.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And Jonathan said to those with him, "Let us rise up now and fight
for our lives, for today things are not as they were before.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` For look! the battle is in front of us and behind us; the water of
the Jordan is on this side and on that, with marsh and thicket; there
is no place to turn.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Cry out now to Heaven that you may be delivered from the hands of
our enemies."
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` So the battle began, and Jonathan stretched out his hand to strike
Bacchides, but he eluded him and went to the rear.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Then Jonathan and the men with him leaped into the Jordan and swam
across to the other side, and the enemy did not cross the Jordan to
attack them.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` And about one thousand of Bacchides' men fell that day.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Bacchides then returned to Jerusalem and built strong cities in
Judea: the fortress in Jericho, and Emmaus, and Beth-horon, and Bethel,
and Timnath, and Pharathon, and Tephon, with high walls and gates and
bars.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` And he placed garrisons in them to harass Israel.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` He also fortified the city of Beth-zur, and Gazara, and the
citadel, and in them he put troops and stores of food.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` And he took the sons of the leading men of the land as hostages and
put them under guard in the citadel at Jerusalem.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` In the one hundred and fifty-third year, in the second month,
Alcimus gave orders to tear down the wall of the inner court of the
sanctuary. He tore down the work of the prophets!
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` But he only began to tear it down, for at that time Alcimus was
stricken and his work was hindered; his mouth was stopped and he was
paralyzed, so that he could no longer say a word or give commands
concerning his house.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` And Alcimus died at that time in great agony.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` When Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king,
and the land of Judah had rest for two years.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` Then all the lawless plotted and said, "See! Jonathan and his men
are living in quiet and confidence. So now let us bring Bacchides back,
and he will capture them all in one night."
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` And they went and consulted with him.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` He started to come with a large force, and secretly sent letters to
all his allies in Judea, telling them to seize Jonathan and his men;
but they were unable to do it, because their plan became known.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` And Jonathan's men seized about fifty of the men of the country who
were leaders in this treachery, and killed them.
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` Then Jonathan with his men, and Simon, withdrew to Bethbasi in the
wilderness; he rebuilt the parts of it that had been demolished, and
they fortified it.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` When Bacchides learned of this, he assembled all his forces, and
sent orders to the men of Judea.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` Then he came and encamped against Bethbasi; he fought against it
for many days and made machines of war.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` But Jonathan left Simon his brother in the city, while he went out
into the country; and he went with only a few men.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` He struck down Odomera and his brothers and the sons of Phasiron in
their tents.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` Then he began to attack and went into battle with his forces; and
Simon and his men sallied out from the city and set fire to the
machines of war.
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` They fought with Bacchides, and he was crushed by them. They
distressed him greatly, for his plan and his expedition had been in
vain.
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` So he was greatly enraged at the lawless men who had counseled him
to come into the country, and he killed many of them. Then he decided
to depart to his own land.
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` When Jonathan learned of this, he sent ambassadors to him to make
peace with him and obtain release of the captives.
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` He agreed, and did as he said; and he swore to Jonathan that he
would not try to harm him as long as he lived.
'''
"72" = ''':sup:`72` He restored to him the captives whom he had formerly taken from the
land of Judah; then he turned and departed to his own land, and came no
more into their territory.
'''
"73" = ''':sup:`73` Thus the sword ceased from Israel. And Jonathan dwelt in Michmash.
And Jonathan began to judge the people, and he destroyed the ungodly
out of Israel.
