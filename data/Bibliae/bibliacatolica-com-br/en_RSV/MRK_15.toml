"1" = ''':sup:`1` And as soon as it was morning the chief priests, with the elders and
scribes, and the whole council held a consultation; and they bound
Jesus and led him away and delivered him to Pilate.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he
answered him, "You have said so."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And the chief priests accused him of many things.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer to make? See how
many charges they bring against you."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate wondered.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom
they asked.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the
insurrection, there was a man called Barab'bas.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he was wont
to do for them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he answered them, "Do you want me to release for you the King of
the Jews?"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had
delivered him up.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for
them Barab'bas instead.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I do with the man
whom you call the King of the Jews?"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And they cried out again, "Crucify him."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they
shouted all the more, "Crucify him."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them
Barab'bas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the
praetorium); and they called together the whole battalion.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of
thorns they put it on him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they
knelt down in homage to him.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple
cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify
him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And they compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyre'ne, who was coming in
from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his
cross.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And they brought him to the place called Gol'gotha (which means the
place of a skull).
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take
it.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them,
casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of
the Jews."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one
on his left.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and
saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three
days,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` save yourself, and come down from the cross!"
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with the
scribes, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross,
that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also
reviled him.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole
land until the ninth hour.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "E'lo-i,
E'lo-i, la'ma sabach-tha'ni?" which means, "My God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me?"
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold, he is calling
Eli'jah."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed
and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Eli'jah
will come to take him down."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus
breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary
Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and
Salo'me,
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him;
and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation,
that is, the day before the sabbath,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Joseph of Arimathe'a, a respected member of the council, who was
also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to
Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the
centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted
the body to Joseph.

15:16-20 - Jesus is mocked by the soldiers, crowned with thorns and

15:21-32 - Jesus carries His cross to Golgotha, where He is crucified.
His suffering is the culmination of the plan of salvation, and the
