Kei'lah, and are robbing the threshing floors."

Philistines?" And the LORD said to David, "Go and attack the
Philistines and save Kei'lah."

"3" = ''':sup:`3` But David's men said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah;
how much more then if we go to Kei'lah against the armies of the
Philistines?"

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then David inquired of the LORD again. And the LORD answered him,
"Arise, go down to Kei'lah; for I will give the Philistines into your
hand."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And David and his men went to Kei'lah, and fought with the
Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and made a great slaughter
among them. So David delivered the inhabitants of Kei'lah.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When Abi'athar the son of Ahim'elech fled to David to Kei'lah, he
came down with an ephod in his hand.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now it was told Saul that David had come to Kei'lah. And Saul said,
"God has given him into my hand; for he has shut himself in by entering
a town that has gates and bars."

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Kei'lah, to
besiege David and his men.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; and he said to

heard that Saul seeks to come to Kei'lah, to destroy the city on my
account.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Will the men of Kei'lah surrender me into his hand? Will Saul come

thee, tell thy servant." And the LORD said, "He will come down."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then said David, "Will the men of Kei'lah surrender me and my men
into the hand of Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will surrender you."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and
departed from Kei'lah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul
was told that David had escaped from Kei'lah, he gave up the
expedition.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the
hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day,
but God did not give him into his hand.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And David was afraid because Saul had come out to seek his life.
David was in the Wilderness of Ziph at Horesh.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` And Jonathan, Saul's son, rose, and went to David at Horesh, and
strengthened his hand in God.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he said to him, "Fear not; for the hand of Saul my father shall
not find you; you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to
you; Saul my father also knows this."

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the two of them made a covenant before the LORD; David remained
at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then the Ziphites went up to Saul at Gib'e-ah, saying, "Does not
David hide among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of
Hachi'lah, which is south of Jeshi'mon?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now come down, O king, according to all your heart's desire to come
down; and our part shall be to surrender him into the king's hand."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And Saul said, "May you be blessed by the LORD; for you have had
compassion on me.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Go, make yet more sure; know and see the place where his haunt is,
and who has seen him there; for it is told me that he is very cunning.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` See therefore, and take note of all the lurking places where he
hides, and come back to me with sure information. Then I will go with
you; and if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the
thousands of Judah."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And they arose, and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his
men were in the wilderness of Ma'on, in the Arabah to the south of
Jeshi'mon.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told;

And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of
Ma'on.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the
other side of the mountain; and David was making haste to get away from
Saul, as Saul and his men were closing in upon David and his men to
capture them,

"27" = ''':sup:`27` when a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Make haste and come; for
the Philistines have made a raid upon the land."
