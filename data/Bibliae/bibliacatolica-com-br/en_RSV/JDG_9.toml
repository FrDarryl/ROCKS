kinsmen, so that they could not live on at Shechem.

Abim'elech was told.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` He took his men and divided them into three companies, and laid
wait in the fields; and he looked and saw the men coming out of the
city, and he rose against them and slew them.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Abim'elech and the company that was with him rushed forward and
stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies
rushed upon all who were in the fields and slew them.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And Abim'elech fought against the city all that day; he took the
city, and killed the people that were in it; and he razed the city and
sowed it with salt.

were gathered together.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And Abim'elech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the men that
were with him; and Abim'elech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a
bundle of brushwood, and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he
said to the men that were with him, "What you have seen me do, make
haste to do, as I have done."
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following
Abim'elech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold
on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also
died, about a thousand men and women.

"50" = ''':sup:`50` Then Abim'elech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and
took it.

"53" = ''':sup:`53` And a certain woman threw an upper millstone upon Abim'elech's
head, and crushed his skull.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` Then he called hastily to the young man his armor-bearer, and said
to him, "Draw your sword and kill me, lest men say of me, `A woman
killed him.'" And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` And when the men of Israel saw that Abim'elech was dead, they
departed every man to his home.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` Thus God requited the crime of Abim'elech, which he committed
against his father in killing his seventy brothers;
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` and God also made all the wickedness of the men of Shechem fall
back upon their heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son
of Jerubba'al.
