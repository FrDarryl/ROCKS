"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then the LORD said to Moses,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Tell the people of Israel to turn back and encamp in front of
Pi-ha-hi'roth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Ba'al-ze'phon;
you shall encamp over against it, by the sea.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` For Pharaoh will say of the people of Israel, `They are entangled in
the land; the wilderness has shut them in.'
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them and I
will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host; and the Egyptians shall
know that I am the LORD." And they did so.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the mind
of Pharaoh and his servants was changed toward the people, and they
said, "What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from
serving us?"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So he made ready his chariot and took his army with him,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and took six hundred picked chariots and all the other chariots of
Egypt with officers over all of them.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he
pursued the people of Israel as they went forth defiantly.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and
his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamped at the sea, by
Pi-ha-hi'roth, in front of Ba'al-ze'phon.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When Pharaoh drew near, the people of Israel lifted up their eyes,
and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were in
great fear. And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and they said to Moses, "Is it because there are no graves in Egypt
that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you
done to us, in bringing us out of Egypt?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Is not this what we said to you in Egypt, `Let us alone and let us
serve the Egyptians'? For it would have been better for us to serve the
Egyptians than to die in the wilderness."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And Moses said to the people, "Fear not, stand firm, and see the
salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today; for the
Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be still."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The LORD said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me? Tell the people of
Israel to go forward.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide
it, that the people of Israel may go on dry ground through the sea.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go
in after them, and I will get glory over Pharaoh and all his host, his
chariots, and his horsemen.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten
glory over Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then the angel of God who went before the host of Israel moved and
went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and
stood behind them,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there
was the cloud and the darkness; and the night passed without one coming
near the other all night.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD drove
the sea back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry
land, and the waters were divided.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And the people of Israel went into the midst of the sea on dry
ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on
their left.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the
sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And in the morning watch the LORD in the pillar of fire and of
cloud looked down upon the host of the Egyptians, and discomfited the
host of the Egyptians,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` clogging their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily; and the
Egyptians said, "Let us flee from before Israel; for the LORD fights
for them against the Egyptians."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea,
that the water may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots,
and upon their horsemen."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` So Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
returned to its wonted flow when the morning appeared; and the
Egyptians fled into it, and the LORD routed the Egyptians in the midst
of the sea.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and
all the host of Pharaoh that had followed them into the sea; not so
much as one of them remained.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` But the people of Israel walked on dry ground through the sea, the
waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians;
and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And Israel saw the great work which the LORD did against the
Egyptians, and the people feared the LORD; and they believed in the
LORD and in his servant Moses.
