increased the more altars he built; as his country improved he improved
his pillars.
'''

break down their altars, and destroy their pillars.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For now they will say: "We have no king, for we fear not the LORD,
and a king, what could he do for us?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` They utter mere words; with empty oaths they make covenants; so
judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The inhabitants of Sama'ria tremble for the calf of Beth-a'ven. Its
people shall mourn for it, and its idolatrous priests shall wail over
it, over its glory which has departed from it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Yea, the thing itself shall be carried to Assyria, as tribute to the
great king. E'phraim shall be put to shame, and Israel shall be ashamed
of his idol.

'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed.

nations shall be gathered against them when they are chastised for
their double iniquity.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` E'phraim was a trained heifer that loved to thresh, and I spared
her fair neck; but I will put E'phraim to the yoke, Judah must plow,
Jacob must harrow for himself.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Sow for yourselves righteousness, reap the fruit of steadfast love;
break up your fallow ground, for it is the time to seek the LORD, that
he may come and rain salvation upon you.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` You have plowed iniquity, you have reaped injustice, you have eaten
the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your chariots and in the
multitude of your warriors,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` therefore the tumult of war shall arise among your people, and all
your fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-ar'bel on
the day of battle; mothers were dashed in pieces with their children.

great wickedness. In the storm the king of Israel shall be utterly cut
off.

Notas de rodap√©:
10:1-2 - Israel's corruption is compared to a vineyard that produced
adulterated fruit. The people, who should have been faithful to God,
became idolatrous and deceitful. Israel's duplicity is the reason for
their separation from God and the promise of judgment (see also
10:3-6 - Israel is described as a nation that, faced with oppression,
seeks a solution in false hopes and its own strength. Dependence on
idols is a major flaw that will lead to the destruction of the kingdom
10:7-10 - Israel's destruction is imminent, with the king being taken
into exile and the nation suffering divine punishment. The people are
being punished for their rebellion, and God laments their destruction,
but justice is necessary because of their unfaithfulness (see also
10:11-12 - God calls Israel to repentance, comparing them to a land in
need of righteousness. He calls the people to cultivate righteousness
10:13-15 - Israel's sin is compared to a deep wound, and the people
will continue to be punished until they repent. God's judgment is
inevitable, but if the people turn to Him, there will be restoration
