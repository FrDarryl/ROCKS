everything that Holofernes, the general of Nebuchadnezzar the king of
the Assyrians, had done to the nations, and how he had plundered and
destroyed all their temples;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` they were therefore very greatly terrified at his approach, and were
alarmed both for Jerusalem and for the temple of the Lord their God.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For they had only recently returned from the captivity, and all the
people of Judea were newly gathered together, and the sacred vessels
and the altar and the temple had been consecrated after their
profanation.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So they sent to every district of Samaria, and to Kona and
Beth-horon and Belmain and Jericho and to Choba and Aesora and the
valley of Salem,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` and immediately seized all the high hilltops and fortified the
villages on them and stored up food in preparation for war -- since
their fields had recently been harvested.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Joakim, the high priest, who was in Jerusalem at the time, wrote
to the people of Bethulia and Betomesthaim, which faces Esdraelon
opposite the plain near Dothan,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` ordering them to seize the passes up into the hills, since by them
Judea could be invaded, and it was easy to stop any who tried to enter,

humbled themselves with much fasting.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` They and their wives and their children and their cattle and every
resident alien and hired laborer and purchased slave -- they all girded
themselves with sackcloth.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And all the men and women of Israel, and their children, living at
Jerusalem, prostrated themselves before the temple and put ashes on
their heads and spread out their sackcloth before the Lord.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` They even surrounded the altar with sackcloth and cried out in
unison, praying earnestly to the God of Israel not to give up their
infants as prey and their wives as booty, and the cities they had
inherited to be destroyed, and the sanctuary to be profaned and
desecrated to the malicious joy of the Gentiles.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So the Lord heard their prayers and looked upon their affliction;
for the people fasted many days throughout Judea and in Jerusalem
before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Joakim the high priest and all the priests who stood before the
Lord and ministered to the Lord, with their loins girded with
sackcloth, offered the continual burnt offerings and the vows and
freewill offerings of the people.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` With ashes upon their turbans, they cried out to the Lord with all
their might to look with favor upon the whole house of Israel.
