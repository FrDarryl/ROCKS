cut off in her punishment, for this is the time of the LORD's
vengeance, the requital he is rendering her.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD's hand, making all the earth
drunken; the nations drank of her wine, therefore the nations went mad.

heavens, and he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth. He
makes lightnings for the rain, and he brings forth the wind from his
storehouses.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Every man is stupid and without knowledge; every goldsmith is put
to shame by his idols; for his images are false, and there is no breath
in them.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` They are worthless, a work of delusion; at the time of their
punishment they shall perish.

to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every side;

the soldiers are in panic.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of
Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a
little while and the time of her harvest will come."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` "Nebuchadrez'zar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has
crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me like a
monster; he has filled his belly with my delicacies, he has rinsed me
out.
'''

has swallowed. The nations shall no longer flow to him; the wall of
Babylon has fallen.

"45" = ''':sup:`45` "Go out of the midst of her, my people! Let every man save his life
from the fierce anger of the LORD!
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Let not your heart faint, and be not fearful at the report heard in
the land, when a report comes in one year and afterward a report in
another year, and violence is in the land, and ruler is against ruler.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` "Therefore, behold, the days are coming when I will punish the
images of Babylon; her whole land shall be put to shame, and all her
slain shall fall in the midst of her.

for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come against them out of
the north, says the LORD.

Remember the LORD from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind:

covered our face, for aliens have come into the holy places of the
LORD's house.'

execute judgment upon her images, and through all her land the wounded
shall groan.

"54" = ''':sup:`54` "Hark! a cry from Babylon! The noise of great destruction from the
land of the Chalde'ans!
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` For the LORD is laying Babylon waste, and stilling her mighty
voice. Their waves roar like many waters, the noise of their voice is
raised;
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` for a destroyer has come upon her, upon Babylon; her warriors are
taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for the LORD is a God of
recompense, he will surely requite.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors, her
commanders, and her warriors; they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and
not wake, says the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` "Thus says the LORD of hosts: The broad wall of Babylon shall be
leveled to the ground and her high gates shall be burned with fire. The
peoples labor for nought, and the nations weary themselves only for
fire."

"59" = ''':sup:`59` The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Serai'ah the son of
Neri'ah, son of Mahsei'ah, when he went with Zedeki'ah king of Judah to
Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. Serai'ah was the
quartermaster.

Babylon, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` And Jeremiah said to Serai'ah: "When you come to Babylon, see that
you read all these words,
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` and say, `O LORD, thou hast said concerning this place that thou
wilt cut it off, so that nothing shall dwell in it, neither man nor
beast, and it shall be desolate for ever.'
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` When you finish reading this book, bind a stone to it, and cast it
into the midst of the Euphra'tes,
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` and say, `Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the
evil that I am bringing upon her.'" Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
