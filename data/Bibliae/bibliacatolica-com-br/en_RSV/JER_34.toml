the LORD concerning you: `You shall not die by the sword.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers,

says the LORD."
'''

Judah, in Jerusalem,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem
and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and
Aze'kah; for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that
remained.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedeki'ah
had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a
proclamation of liberty to them,

'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your

of bondage, saying,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` `At the end of six years each of you must set free the fellow
Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must
set him free from your service.' But your fathers did not listen to me
or incline their ears to me.
'''

proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant
before me in the house which is called by my name;

slaves.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me by
proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor;
behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to
famine, says the LORD. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of
the earth.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms

priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of
the calf;

"20" = ''':sup:`20` and I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the
hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for
the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And Zedeki'ah king of Judah, and his princes I will give into the
hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives,
into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn
from you.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Behold, I will command, says the LORD, and will bring them back to
this city; and they will fight against it, and take it, and burn it
with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without
