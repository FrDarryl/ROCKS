"1" = ''':sup:`1` And Bo'az went up to the gate and sat down there; and behold, the
next of kin, of whom Bo'az had spoken, came by. So Bo'az said, "Turn
aside, friend; sit down here"; and he turned aside and sat down.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, "Sit down
here"; so they sat down.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then he said to the next of kin, "Na'omi, who has come back from the
country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land which belonged to our
kinsman Elim'elech.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So I thought I would tell you of it, and say, Buy it in the presence
of those sitting here, and in the presence of the elders of my people.
If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not, tell me, that I
may know, for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I come
after you." And he said, "I will redeem it."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then Bo'az said, "The day you buy the field from the hand of Na'omi,
you are also buying Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the dead, in order
to restore the name of the dead to his inheritance."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then the next of kin said, "I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I
impair my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption yourself, for I
cannot redeem it."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning
redeeming and exchanging: to confirm a transaction, the one drew off
his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was the manner of
attesting in Israel.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So when the next of kin said to Bo'az, "Buy it for yourself," he
drew off his sandal.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Bo'az said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses
this day that I have bought from the hand of Na'omi all that belonged
to Elim'elech and all that belonged to Chil'ion and to Mahlon.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Also Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have bought to be
my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance, that
the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and
from the gate of his native place; you are witnesses this day."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, "We
are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman, who is coming into your
house, like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel.
May you prosper in Eph'rathah and be renowned in Bethlehem;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to
Judah, because of the children that the LORD will give you by this
young woman."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Bo'az took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her,
and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then the women said to Na'omi, "Blessed be the LORD, who has not
left you this day without next of kin; and may his name be renowned in
Israel!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old
age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than
seven sons, has borne him."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then Na'omi took the child and laid him in her bosom, and became
his nurse.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the women of the neighborhood gave him a name, saying, "A son
has been born to Na'omi." They named him Obed; he was the father of
Jesse, the father of David.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of
Hezron,
