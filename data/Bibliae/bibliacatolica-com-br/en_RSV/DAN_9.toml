the number of years which, according to the word of the LORD to
Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of
Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then I turned my face to the Lord God, seeking him by prayer and
supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I prayed to the LORD my God and made confession, saying, "O Lord,
the great and terrible God, who keepest covenant and steadfast love

"7" = ''':sup:`7` To thee, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us confusion of face,
as at this day, to the men of Judah, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,

"25" = ''':sup:`25` Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the word
to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a
prince, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall
be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off,
and shall have nothing; and the people of the prince who is to come
shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a
