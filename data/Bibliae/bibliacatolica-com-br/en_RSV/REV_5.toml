"4" = ''':sup:`4` and I wept much that no one was found worthy to open the scroll or

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then one of the elders said to me, "Weep not; lo, the Lion of the

Notas de rodap√©:
5:1-5 - John sees the scroll sealed with seven seals, and no one is
worthy to open it until the Lamb, Christ, appears as the one worthy to
open the seals. Christ's victory over death makes Him worthy to reveal
5:6-10 - The Lamb is described as having been slain and worthy of
worship from all creation. His work of redemption is universal, and His
5:11-14 - Worship of the Lamb extends to all the heavenly orders,
showing that Christ is the center of all worship in heaven and on
earth. Christ's victory is an invitation for all creation to surrender
