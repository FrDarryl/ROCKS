"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnez'zar, Nebuchadnez'zar
had dreams; and his spirit was troubled, and his sleep left him.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then the king commanded that the magicians, the enchanters, the
sorcerers, and the Chalde'ans be summoned, to tell the king his dreams.
So they came in and stood before the king.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And the king said to them, "I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled
to know the dream."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then the Chalde'ans said to the king, "O king, live for ever! Tell
your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The king answered the Chalde'ans, "The word from me is sure: if you
do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be
torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive
from me gifts and rewards and great honor. Therefore show me the dream
and its interpretation."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` They answered a second time, "Let the king tell his servants the
dream, and we will show its interpretation."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The king answered, "I know with certainty that you are trying to
gain time, because you see that the word from me is sure
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` that if you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one
sentence for you. You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words
before me till the times change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I
shall know that you can show me its interpretation."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The Chalde'ans answered the king, "There is not a man on earth who
can meet the king's demand; for no great and powerful king has asked
such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chalde'an.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The thing that the king asks is difficult, and none can show it to
the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Because of this the king was angry and very furious, and commanded
that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So the decree went forth that the wise men were to be slain, and
they sought Daniel and his companions, to slay them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then Daniel replied with prudence and discretion to Ar'i-och, the
captain of the king's guard, who had gone out to slay the wise men of
Babylon;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` he said to Ar'i-och, the king's captain, "Why is the decree of the
king so severe?" Then Ar'i-och made the matter known to Daniel.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And Daniel went in and besought the king to appoint him a time,
that he might show to the king the interpretation.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then Daniel went to his house and made the matter known to
Hanani'ah, Mish'a-el, and Azari'ah, his companions,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and told them to seek mercy of the God of heaven concerning this
mystery, so that Daniel and his companions might not perish with the
rest of the wise men of Babylon.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night.
Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Daniel said: "Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever. to whom
belong wisdom and might.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` He changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings;
he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have
understanding;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` he reveals deep and mysterious things; he knows what is in the
darkness, and the light dwells with him.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` To thee, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, for thou
hast given me wisdom and strength, and hast now made known to me what
we asked of thee, for thou hast made known to us the king's matter."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Therefore Daniel went in to Ar'i-och, whom the king had appointed
to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus to him, "Do
not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I
will show the king the interpretation."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then Ar'i-och brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said
thus to him: "I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who can
make known to the king the interpretation."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` The king said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshaz'zar, "Are you
able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its
interpretation?"
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Daniel answered the king, "No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or
astrologers can show to the king the mystery which the king has asked,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has made
known to King Nebuchadnez'zar what will be in the latter days. Your
dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these:
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be
hereafter, and he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to
be.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But as for me, not because of any wisdom that I have more than all
the living has this mystery been revealed to me, but in order that the
interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the
thoughts of your mind.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` "You saw, O king, and behold, a great image. This image, mighty and
of exceeding brightness, stood before you, and its appearance was
frightening.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The head of this image was of fine gold, its breast and arms of
silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand, and it smote
the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all
together were broken in pieces, and became like the chaff of the summer
threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, so that not a trace
of them could be found. But the stone that struck the image became a
great mountain and filled the whole earth.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` "This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given
the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the sons of
men, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the air, making you rule
over them all -- you are the head of gold.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` After you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, and yet a
third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron, because iron
breaks to pieces and shatters all things; and like iron which crushes,
it shall break and crush all these.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And as you saw the feet and toes partly of potter's clay and partly
of iron, it shall be a divided kingdom; but some of the firmness of
iron shall be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the miry clay.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And as the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly clay, so
the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly brittle.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` As you saw the iron mixed with miry clay, so they will mix with one
another in marriage, but they will not hold together, just as iron does
not mix with clay.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a
kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be
left to another people. It shall break in pieces all these kingdoms and
bring them to an end, and it shall stand for ever;
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` just as you saw that a stone was cut from a mountain by no human
hand, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the bronze, the clay, the
silver, and the gold. A great God has made known to the king what shall
be hereafter. The dream is certain, and its interpretation sure."
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Then King Nebuchadnez'zar fell upon his face, and did homage to
Daniel, and commanded that an offering and incense be offered up to
him.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` The king said to Daniel, "Truly, your God is God of gods and Lord
of kings, and a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal
this mystery."
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Then the king gave Daniel high honors and many great gifts, and
made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief prefect
over all the wise men of Babylon.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Daniel made request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abed'nego over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but
Daniel remained at the king's court.
