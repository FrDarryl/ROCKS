"1" = ''':sup:`1` Thus says the LORD: "Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and
speak there this word,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and say, `Hear the word of the LORD, O King of Judah, who sit on the
throne of David, you, and your servants, and your people who enter
these gates.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Thus says the LORD: Do justice and righteousness, and deliver from
the hand of the oppressor him who has been robbed. And do no wrong or
violence to the alien, the fatherless, and the widow, nor shed innocent
blood in this place.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For if you will indeed obey this word, then there shall enter the
gates of this house kings who sit on the throne of David, riding in
chariots and on horses, they, and their servants, and their people.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But if you will not heed these words, I swear by myself, says the
LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah:
"`You are as Gilead to me, as the summit of Lebanon, yet surely I will
make you a desert, an uninhabited city.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` I will prepare destroyers against you, each with his weapons; and
they shall cut down your choicest cedars, and cast them into the fire.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` "`And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to
his neighbor, "Why has the LORD dealt thus with this great city?"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And they will answer, "Because they forsook the covenant of the LORD
their God, and worshiped other gods and served them."'"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Weep not for him who is dead, nor bemoan him; but weep bitterly for
him who goes away, for he shall return no more to see his native land.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josi'ah, king
of Judah, who reigned instead of Josi'ah his father, and who went away
from this place: "He shall return here no more,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` but in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall
he die, and he shall never see this land again."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` "Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his upper
rooms by injustice; who makes his neighbor serve him for nothing, and
does not give him his wages;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` who says, `I will build myself a great house with spacious upper
rooms,' and cuts out windows for it, paneling it with cedar, and
painting it with vermilion.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Do you think you are a king because you compete in cedar? Did not
your father eat and drink and do justice and righteousness? Then it was
well with him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Is not
this to know me? says the LORD.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But you have eyes and heart only for your dishonest gain, for
shedding innocent blood, and for practicing oppression and violence."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoi'akim the son of
Josi'ah, king of Judah: "They shall not lament for him, saying, `Ah my
brother!' or `Ah sister!' They shall not lament for him, saying, `Ah
lord!' or `Ah his majesty!'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` With the burial of an ass he shall be buried, dragged and cast
forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` "Go up to Lebanon, and cry out, and lift up your voice in Bashan;
cry from Ab'arim, for all your lovers are destroyed.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, `I will not
listen.' This has been your way from your youth, that you have not
obeyed my voice.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The wind shall shepherd all your shepherds, and your lovers shall
go into captivity; then you will be ashamed and confounded because of
all your wickedness.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` O inhabitant of Lebanon, nested among the cedars, how you will
groan when pangs come upon you, pain as of a woman in travail!"
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "As I live, says the LORD, though Coni'ah the son of Jehoi'akim,
king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear
you off
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the
hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of
Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chalde'ans.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country,
where you were not born, and there you shall die.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall
not return."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Is this man Coni'ah a despised, broken pot, a vessel no one cares
for? Why are he and his children hurled and cast into a land which they
do not know?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD!
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Thus says the LORD: "Write this man down as childless, a man who
shall not succeed in his days; for none of his offspring shall succeed
in sitting on the throne of David, and ruling again in Judah."

Notas de rodap√©:
22:1-5 - The warning to Jehoiakim, king of Judah, is clear: his
disobedience will bring destruction. The promise that Jerusalem would

will be cut off from the throne of Judah. The fall of his house
