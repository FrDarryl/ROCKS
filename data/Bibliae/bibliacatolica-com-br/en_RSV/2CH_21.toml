Zechari'ah, Azari'ah, Michael, and Shephati'ah; all these were the sons
of Jehosh'aphat king of Judah.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Their father gave them great gifts, of silver, gold, and valuable
possessions, together with fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the

reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of
Ahab had done; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife. And he did what
was evil in the sight of the LORD.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Yet the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the

and he rose by night and smote the E'domites who had surrounded him and
his chariot commanders.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So Edom revolted from the rule of Judah to this day. At that time

king of Judah,

"13" = ''':sup:`13` but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have led

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
incurable disease.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` In course of time, at the end of two years, his bowels came out
because of the disease, and he died in great agony. His people made no
fire in his honor, like the fires made for his fathers.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
eight years in Jerusalem; and he departed with no one's regret. They
buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
