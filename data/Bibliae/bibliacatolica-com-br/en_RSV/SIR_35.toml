Obedience to God's will is seen as a true sacrifice, reflecting that
justice and righteousness are more important than mere rituals (see
35:7-9 - Generous giving, given cheerfully, is pleasing to God. God
loves a generous heart, and charity and justice are essential to
19:17).

the humble and the afflicted, demonstrating that divine justice is
impartial and always favors those who seek His mercy (see also
35:16-18 - The prayers of the poor and the fatherless go straight to
God's throne. The cries of those who suffer are heard and answered, a
