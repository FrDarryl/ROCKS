planters shall plant, and shall enjoy the fruit.

company, they shall return here.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` With weeping they shall come, and with consolations I will lead them

wine, and the oil, and over the young of the flock and the herd; their
life shall be like a watered garden, and they shall languish no more.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then shall the maidens rejoice in the dance, and the young men and

shall be satisfied with my goodness, says the LORD."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Thus says the LORD: "A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and
bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be
comforted for her children, because they are not."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Thus says the LORD: "Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes
from tears; for your work shall be rewarded, says the LORD, and they

shall come back to their own country.

chastened, like an untrained calf; bring me back that I may be
restored, for thou art the LORD my God.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` For after I had turned away I repented; and after I was instructed,
I smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed, and I was confounded, because I
bore the disgrace of my youth.'

speak against him, I do remember him still. Therefore my heart yearns
for him; I will surely have mercy on him, says the LORD.

well the highway, the road by which you went. Return, O virgin Israel,
return to these your cities.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` How long will you waver, O faithless daughter? For the LORD has
created a new thing on the earth: a woman protects a man."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: "Once more they
shall use these words in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I
restore their fortunes: `The LORD bless you, O habitation of
righteousness, O holy hill!'
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Judah and all its cities shall dwell there together, and the
farmers and those who wander with their flocks.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For I will satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul I
will replenish."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Thereupon I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` "Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will sow the
house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the
seed of beast.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And it shall come to pass that as I have watched over them to pluck
up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring evil, so I will
watch over them to build and to plant, says the LORD.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` In those days they shall no longer say: `The fathers have eaten
sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But every one shall die for his own sin; each man who eats sour
grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` "Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` not like the covenant which I made with their fathers when I took
them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant
which they broke, though I was their husband, says the LORD.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel
after those days, says the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I
will write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they
shall be my people.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And no longer shall each man teach his neighbor and each his
brother, saying, `Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me, from the
least of them to the greatest, says the LORD; for I will forgive their
iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Thus says the LORD, who gives the sun for light by day and the
fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night, who stirs up
the sea so that its waves roar -- the LORD of hosts is his name:
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` "If this fixed order departs from before me, says the LORD, then
shall the descendants of Israel cease from being a nation before me for
ever."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Thus says the LORD: "If the heavens above can be measured, and the
foundations of the earth below can be explored, then I will cast off
all the descendants of Israel for all that they have done, says the
LORD."

"38" = ''':sup:`38` "Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when the city shall be
rebuilt for the LORD from the tower of Han'anel to the Corner Gate.
'''

Gareb, and shall then turn to Go'ah.

fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate
toward the east, shall be sacred to the LORD. It shall not be uprooted
or overthrown any more for ever."
