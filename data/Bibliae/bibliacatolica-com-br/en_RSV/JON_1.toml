"2" = ''':sup:`2` "Arise, go to Nin'eveh, that great city, and cry against it; for
their wickedness has come up before me."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. He
went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the
fare, and went on board, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the
presence of the LORD.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the LORD hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a
mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried to his god; and they
threw the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for
them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had
lain down, and was fast asleep.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So the captain came and said to him, "What do you mean, you sleeper?
Arise, call upon your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us,
that we do not perish."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And they said to one another, "Come, let us cast lots, that we may
know on whose account this evil has come upon us." So they cast lots,
and the lot fell upon Jonah.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then they said to him, "Tell us, on whose account this evil has come
upon us? What is your occupation? And whence do you come? What is your
country? And of what people are you?"
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he said to them, "I am a Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of
heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, "What is
this that you have done!" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the
presence of the LORD, because he had told them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then they said to him, "What shall we do to you, that the sea may
quiet down for us?" For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He said to them, "Take me up and throw me into the sea; then the
sea will quiet down for you; for I know it is because of me that this
great tempest has come upon you."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring the ship back to land, but
they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against
them.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Therefore they cried to the LORD, "We beseech thee, O LORD, let us
not perish for this man's life, and lay not on us innocent blood; for
thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So they took up Jonah and threw him into the sea; and the sea
ceased from its raging.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and they offered a
sacrifice to the LORD and made vows.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the LORD appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah
was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
