the waters subsided;

"2" = ''':sup:`2` the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were
closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,

"3" = ''':sup:`3` and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of a

ark came to rest upon the mountains of Ar'arat.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the
tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains
were seen.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he
had made,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and sent forth a raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were
dried up from the earth.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had
subsided from the face of the ground;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him
to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth.
So he put forth his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with
him.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out

a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided
from the earth.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then he waited another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she
did not return to him any more.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first
day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth; and Noah
removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of
the ground was dry.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the
earth was dry.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Go forth from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your
sons' wives with you.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all
flesh -- birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the
earth -- that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful
and multiply upon the earth."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` So Noah went forth, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives
with him.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything
that moves upon the earth, went forth by families out of the ark.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean
animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the
altar.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor, the LORD said in his
heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the
imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever
again destroy every living creature as I have done.

summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease."
