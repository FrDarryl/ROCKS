down into the house where she lived on sabbaths and on her feast days;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and she removed the sackcloth which she had been wearing, and took
off her widow's garments, and bathed her body with water, and anointed

"5" = ''':sup:`5` And she gave her maid a bottle of wine and a flask of oil, and

she worshiped God.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then she said to them, "Order the gate of the city to be opened for
me, and I will go out and accomplish the things about which you spoke
with me." So they ordered the young men to open the gate for her, as
she had said.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When they had done this, Judith went out, she and her maid with
her; and the men of the city watched her until she had gone down the
mountain and passed through the valley and they could no longer see
her.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The women went straight on through the valley; and an Assyrian
patrol met her

"12" = ''':sup:`12` and took her into custody, and asked her, "To what people do you
belong, and where are you coming from, and where are you going?" She
replied, "I am a daughter of the Hebrews, but I am fleeing from them,
for they are about to be handed over to you to be devoured.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I am on my way to the presence of Holofernes the commander of your
army, to give him a true report; and I will show him a way by which he
can go and capture all the hill country without losing one of his men,

"14" = ''':sup:`14` When the men heard her words, and observed her face -- she was in
their eyes marvelously beautiful -- they said to her,

"15" = ''':sup:`15` "You have saved your life by hurrying down to the presence of our
lord. Go at once to his tent; some of us will escort you and hand you
over to him.

maid, and they brought them to the tent of Holofernes.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` There was great excitement in the whole camp, for her arrival was
reported from tent to tent, and they came and stood around her as she
waited outside the tent of Holofernes while they told him about her.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And they marveled at her beauty, and admired the Israelites,
judging them by her, and every one said to his neighbor, "Who can
despise these people, who have women like this among them? Surely not a
man of them had better be left alive, for if we let them go they will
be able to ensnare the whole world!"

"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Holofernes' companions and all his servants came out and led
her into the tent.
