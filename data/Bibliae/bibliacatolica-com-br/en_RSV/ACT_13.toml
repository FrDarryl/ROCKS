"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers,
Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyre'ne, Man'a-en a
member of the court of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit
said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have
called them."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and
sent them off.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleu'cia;
and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When they arrived at Sal'amis, they proclaimed the word of God in
the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they
came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence,
who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But El'ymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name)
withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit,
looked intently at him
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and said, "You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness,
full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the
straight paths of the Lord?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be
blind and unable to see the sun for a time." Immediately mist and
darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking people to lead him by
the hand.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he
was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in
Pamphyl'ia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` but they passed on from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisid'ia. And
on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the
synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of
exhortation for the people, say it."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: "Men of Israel,
and you that fear God, listen.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people
great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he
led them out of it.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And for about forty years he bore with them in the wilderness.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he
gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and
fifty years.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul the son of Kish,
a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king;
of whom he testified and said, `I have found in David the son of Jesse
a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Of this man's posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus,
as he promised.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all
the people of Israel.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And as John was finishing his course, he said, `What do you suppose
that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of
whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` "Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that
fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did
not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets which
are read every sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Though they could charge him with nothing deserving death, yet they
asked Pilate to have him killed.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took
him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But God raised him from the dead;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from
Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the
fathers,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus; as
also it is written in the second psalm, `Thou art my Son, today I have
begotten thee.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to
return to corruption, he spoke in this way, `I will give you the holy
and sure blessings of David.'
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Therefore he says also in another psalm, `Thou wilt not let thy
Holy One see corruption.'
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` For David, after he had served the counsel of God in his own
generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw
corruption;
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Let it be known to you therefore, brethren, that through this man
forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` and by him every one that believes is freed from everything from
which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Beware, therefore, lest there come upon you what is said in the
prophets:
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` `Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I do a deed in
your days, a deed you will never believe, if one declares it to you.'"
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told
them the next sabbath.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And when the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and
devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to
them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` The next sabbath almost the whole city gathered together to hear
the word of God.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with
jealousy, and contradicted what was spoken by Paul, and reviled him.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, "It was necessary
that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it
from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we
turn to the Gentiles.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, `I have set you to be a
light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the uttermost
parts of the earth.'"
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the
word of God; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` And the word of the Lord spread throughout all the region.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the
leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and
Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and went
to Ico'nium.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

13:1-3 - The separation of Barnabas and Saul for the mission is an
example of how the early Church was guided by the Holy Spirit in its
decisions, highlighting the sending of missionaries for evangelistic
13:6-12 - The confrontation between Paul and Elymas the sorcerer
demonstrates God's power against the forces of evil. Elymas's temporary
blindness serves as a symbol of the spiritual blindness of many to the
15:14).
13:16-41 - Paul preaches in the synagogue of Pisidian Antioch,
emphasizing that Jesus is the fulfillment of the promises made to
Israel. His preaching points to the resurrection as the foundation of
1:4).
13:44-52 - Jewish opposition to Paul's message reflects resistance to
the new covenant in Christ, but Paul and Barnabas' response in turning
to the Gentiles shows the universal mission of the gospel (see also
13:50-52 - The persecution of Paul and Barnabas in Antioch highlights
the cost of mission and the resistance that often accompanies preaching
the gospel. The disciples' joy in the face of persecution demonstrates
5:41).
