against him;

my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted; and on
the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she
told the riddle to her countrymen.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the

lion?" And he said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you
would not have found out my riddle."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he went down
to Ash'kelon and killed thirty men of the town, and took their spoil

man.
