"1" = ''':sup:`1` Three years later, word came to Judas and his men that Demetrius,
the son of Seleucus, had sailed into the harbor of Tripolis with a
strong army and a fleet,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and had taken possession of the country, having made away with
Antiochus and his guardian Lysias.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now a certain Alcimus, who had formerly been high priest but had
wilfully defiled himself in the times of separation, realized that
there was no way for him to be safe or to have access again to the holy
altar,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and went to King Demetrius in about the one hundred and fifty-first
year, presenting to him a crown of gold and a palm, and besides these
some of the customary olive branches from the temple. During that day
he kept quiet.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But he found an opportunity that furthered his mad purpose when he
was invited by Demetrius to a meeting of the council and was asked
about the disposition and intentions of the Jews. He answered:
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` "Those of the Jews who are called Hasideans, whose leader is Judas
Maccabeus, are keeping up war and stirring up sedition, and will not
let the kingdom attain tranquillity.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Therefore I have laid aside my ancestral glory -- I mean the high
priesthood -- and have now come here,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` first because I am genuinely concerned for the interests of the
king, and second because I have regard also for my fellow citizens. For
through the folly of those whom I have mentioned our whole nation is
now in no small misfortune.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Since you are acquainted, O king, with the details of this matter,
deign to take thought for our country and our hard-pressed nation with
the gracious kindness which you show to all.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For as long as Judas lives, it is impossible for the government to
find peace."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When he had said this, the rest of the king's friends, who were
hostile to Judas, quickly inflamed Demetrius still more.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he immediately chose Nicanor, who had been in command of the
elephants, appointed him governor of Judea, and sent him off
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` with orders to kill Judas and scatter his men, and to set up
Alcimus as high priest of the greatest temple.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the Gentiles throughout Judea, who had fled before Judas,
flocked to join Nicanor, thinking that the misfortunes and calamities
of the Jews would mean prosperity for themselves.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming and the gathering of the
Gentiles, they sprinkled dust upon their heads and prayed to him who
established his own people for ever and always upholds his own heritage
by manifesting himself.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` At the command of the leader, they set out from there immediately
and engaged them in battle at a village called Dessau.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Simon, the brother of Judas, had encountered Nicanor, but had been
temporarily checked because of the sudden consternation created by the
enemy.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the valor of Judas and his men and
their courage in battle for their country, shrank from deciding the
issue by bloodshed.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Therefore he sent Posidonius and Theodotus and Mattathias to give
and receive pledges of friendship.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` When the terms had been fully considered, and the leader had
informed the people, and it had appeared that they were of one mind,
they agreed to the covenant.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the leaders set a day on which to meet by themselves. A chariot
came forward from each army; seats of honor were set in place;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Judas posted armed men in readiness at key places to prevent sudden
treachery on the part of the enemy; they held the proper conference.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Nicanor stayed on in Jerusalem and did nothing out of the way, but
dismissed the flocks of people that had gathered.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And he kept Judas always in his presence; he was warmly attached to
the man.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And he urged him to marry and have children; so he married, settled
down, and shared the common life.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But when Alcimus noticed their good will for one another, he took
the covenant that had been made and went to Demetrius. He told him that
Nicanor was disloyal to the government, for he had appointed that
conspirator against the kingdom, Judas, to be his successor.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` The king became excited and, provoked by the false accusations of
that depraved man, wrote to Nicanor, stating that he was displeased
with the covenant and commanding him to send Maccabeus to Antioch as a
prisoner without delay.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When this message came to Nicanor, he was troubled and grieved that
he had to annul their agreement when the man had done no wrong.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Since it was not possible to oppose the king, he watched for an
opportunity to accomplish this by a stratagem.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But Maccabeus, noticing that Nicanor was more austere in his
dealings with him and was meeting him more rudely than had been his
custom, concluded that this austerity did not spring from the best
motives. So he gathered not a few of his men, and went into hiding from
Nicanor.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` When the latter became aware that he had been cleverly outwitted by
the man, he went to the great and holy temple while the priests were
offering the customary sacrifices, and commanded them to hand the man
over.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And when they declared on oath that they did not know where the man
was whom he sought,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` he stretched out his right hand toward the sanctuary, and swore
this oath: "If you do not hand Judas over to me as a prisoner, I will
level this precinct of God to the ground and tear down the altar, and I
will build here a splendid temple to Dionysus."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Having said this, he went away. Then the priests stretched forth
their hands toward heaven and called upon the constant Defender of our
nation, in these words:
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` "O Lord of all, who hast need of nothing, thou wast pleased that
there be a temple for thy habitation among us;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` so now, O holy One, Lord of all holiness, keep undefiled for ever
this house that has been so recently purified."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` A certain Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, was denounced to
Nicanor as a man who loved his fellow citizens and was very well
thought of and for his good will was called father of the Jews.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` For in former times, when there was no mingling with the Gentiles,
he had been accused of Judaism, and for Judaism he had with all zeal
risked body and life.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Nicanor, wishing to exhibit the enmity which he had for the Jews,
sent more than five hundred soldiers to arrest him;
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` for he thought that by arresting him he would do them an injury.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` When the troops were about to capture the tower and were forcing
the door of the courtyard, they ordered that fire be brought and the
doors burned. Being surrounded, Razis fell upon his own sword,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` preferring to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of
sinners and suffer outrages unworthy of his noble birth.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` But in the heat of the struggle he did not hit exactly, and the
crowd was now rushing in through the doors. He bravely ran up on the
wall, and manfully threw himself down into the crowd.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` But as they quickly drew back, a space opened and he fell in the
middle of the empty space.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Still alive and aflame with anger, he rose, and though his blood
gushed forth and his wounds were severe he ran through the crowd; and
standing upon a steep rock,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` with his blood now completely drained from him, he tore out his
entrails, took them with both hands and hurled them at the crowd,
calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to give them back to him
again. This was the manner of his death.
