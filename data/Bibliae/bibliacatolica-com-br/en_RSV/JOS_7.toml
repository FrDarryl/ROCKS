"1" = ''':sup:`1` But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted
things; for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the
tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things; and the anger of the
LORD burned against the people of Israel.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-a'ven, east
of Bethel, and said to them, "Go up and spy out the land." And the men
went up and spied out Ai.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, "Let not all the
people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack
Ai; do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are but few."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So about three thousand went up there from the people; and they fled
before the men of Ai,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six men of them, and chased
them before the gate as far as Sheb'arim, and slew them at the descent.
And the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face
before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of
Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou brought this
people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the
Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond
the Jordan!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before
their enemies!
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of
it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth; and what
wilt thou do for thy great name?"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The LORD said to Joshua, "Arise, why have you thus fallen upon your
face?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant which I
commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have
stolen, and lied, and put them among their own stuff.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies;
they turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become a
thing for destruction. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy
the devoted things from among you.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Up, sanctify the people, and say, `Sanctify yourselves for
tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, God of Israel, "There are devoted
things in the midst of you, O Israel; you cannot stand before your
enemies, until you take away the devoted things from among you."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes;
and the tribe which the LORD takes shall come near by families; and the
family which the LORD takes shall come near by households; and the
household which the LORD takes shall come near man by man.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with
fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant
of the LORD, and because he has done a shameful thing in Israel.'"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel near tribe
by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and he brought near the families of Judah, and the family of the
Zer'ahites was taken; and he brought near the family of the Zer'ahites
man by man, and Zabdi was taken;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of
Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD God of
Israel, and render praise to him; and tell me now what you have done;
do not hide it from me."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Achan answered Joshua, "Of a truth I have sinned against the
LORD God of Israel, and this is what I did:
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar, and two
hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels,
then I coveted them, and took them; and behold, they are hidden in the
earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it
was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and
all the people of Israel; and they laid them down before the LORD.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and
the silver and the mantle and the bar of gold, and his sons and
daughters, and his oxen and asses and sheep, and his tent, and all that
he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And Joshua said, "Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD brings
trouble on you today." And all Israel stoned him with stones; they
burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to
this day; then the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore to
this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor.

Notas de rodap√©:
7:1 - Achan's sin in taking items destined for destruction brings
defeat to Israel at Ai. This emphasizes the importance of holiness and
obedience to God's Word, showing how individual sin can affect the
6:7).
7:2-5 - The defeat at Ai and the distrust it generated among the
Israelites demonstrate that victory is assured only by obedience to
God. Self-reliance can lead to downfall and disillusionment (see also
7:6-9 - Joshua's intercession, questioning God about the defeat,
highlights the importance of communicating with the Lord in times of
crisis. Prayer is an essential tool for seeking guidance and
7:10-13 - God reveals the cause of the defeat, showing that
disobedience brought a curse upon Israel. This highlights the need for
holiness and the seriousness of sin, reinforcing the need to rid
Peter 1:15-16).
7:19-26 - The judgment of Achan and the destruction of his family
highlight the gravity of sin and the need to restore the holiness of
God's people. This teaches about the consequences of sin and the
12:1-2).
