"2" = ''':sup:`2` The name of the man was Elim'elech and the name of his wife Na'omi,
and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chil'ion; they were
Eph'rathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of
Moab and remained there.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` and both Mahlon and Chil'ion died, so that the woman was bereft of
her two sons and her husband.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then she started with her daughters-in-law to return from the
country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the LORD
had visited his people and given them food.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` So she set out from the place where she was, with her two
daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of
Judah.

to her mother's house. May the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have
dealt with the dead and with me.

wept.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` And they said to her, "No, we will return with you to your people."

"11" = ''':sup:`11` But Na'omi said, "Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me?
Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a
husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband
this night and should bear sons,

"13" = ''':sup:`13` would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore
refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter
to me for your sake that the hand of the LORD has gone forth against
me."

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed
her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` And she said, "See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people
and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But Ruth said, "Entreat me not to leave you or to return from
following you; for where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will
lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the LORD
do so to me and more also if even death parts me from you."

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And when Na'omi saw that she was determined to go with her, she
said no more.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when
they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them; and
the women said, "Is this Na'omi?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` She said to them, "Do not call me Na'omi, call me Mara, for the
Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` I went away full, and the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call
me Na'omi, when the LORD has afflicted me and the Almighty has brought
calamity upon me?"
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Na'omi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with
her, who returned from the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem
at the beginning of barley harvest.
