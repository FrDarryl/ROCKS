"1" = ''':sup:`1` I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no better than a
slave, though he is the owner of all the estate;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` but he is under guardians and trustees until the date set by the
father.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So with us; when we were children, we were slaves to the elemental
spirits of the universe.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But when the time had fully come, God sent forth his Son, born of
woman, born under the law,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive
adoption as sons.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into
our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So through God you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son
then an heir.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Formerly, when you did not know God, you were in bondage to beings
that by nature are no gods;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` but now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by
God, how can you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elemental
spirits, whose slaves you want to be once more?
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` You observe days, and months, and seasons, and years!
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I am afraid I have labored over you in vain.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Brethren, I beseech you, become as I am, for I also have become as
you are. You did me no wrong;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` you know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the
gospel to you at first;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or
despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` What has become of the satisfaction you felt? For I bear you
witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and
given them to me.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They make much of you, but for no good purpose; they want to shut
you out, that you may make much of them.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For a good purpose it is always good to be made much of, and not
only when I am present with you.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` My little children, with whom I am again in travail until Christ be
formed in you!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for
I am perplexed about you.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Tell me, you who desire to be under law, do you not hear the law?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave and one
by a free woman.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, the son
of the free woman through promise.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Now this is an allegory: these women are two covenants. One is from
Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present
Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For it is written, "Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break
forth and shout, you who are not in travail; for the children of the
desolate one are many more than the children of her that is married."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Now we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh
persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` But what does the scripture say? "Cast out the slave and her son;
for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free
woman."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So, brethren, we are not children of the slave but of the free
woman.

4:1-7 - Paul explains that before Christ, Christians were like servants
under the law, but now, as adopted children of God, they have the

4:8-11 - Paul expresses his concern for the Galatians, warning them
about the risk of returning to the practices of the law and abandoning
grace. True freedom is found in Christ, not in keeping the law (see
4:12-20 - Paul reminds the Galatians of his early relationship with
them and his love for them. This conversation about the travails of a
spiritual father reflects Paul's concern for the purity of the gospel

freedom that comes from Christ with the slavery of the law. The
allusion to Mount Sinai shows that the law creates slavery, while the

04:31 - Paul concludes by saying that Christians are children of
promise, not of slavery. The new covenant in Christ brings true freedom
