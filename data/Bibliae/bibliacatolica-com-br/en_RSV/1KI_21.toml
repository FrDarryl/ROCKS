"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the
palace of Ahab king of Sama'ria.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And after this Ahab said to Naboth, "Give me your vineyard, that I
may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; and I
will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I
will give you its value in money."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But Naboth said to Ahab, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the
inheritance of my fathers."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And Ahab went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth
the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, "I will not give you
the inheritance of my fathers." And he lay down on his bed, and turned
away his face, and would eat no food.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But Jez'ebel his wife came to him, and said to him, "Why is your
spirit so vexed that you eat no food?"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he said to her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and
said to him, `Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please
you, I will give you another vineyard for it'; and he answered, `I will
not give you my vineyard.'"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Jez'ebel his wife said to him, "Do you now govern Israel? Arise,
and eat bread, and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the
vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal,
and she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who dwelt with
Naboth in his city.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And she wrote in the letters, "Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on
high among the people;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and set two base fellows opposite him, and let them bring a charge
against him, saying, `You have cursed God and the king.' Then take him
out, and stone him to death."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the men of his city, the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his
city, did as Jez'ebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the
letters which she had sent to them,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` they proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the two base fellows came in and sat opposite him; and the base
fellows brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people,
saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." So they took him outside the
city, and stoned him to death with stones.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Then they sent to Jez'ebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned; he is
dead."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` As soon as Jez'ebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead,
Jez'ebel said to Ahab, "Arise, take possession of the vineyard of
Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for
Naboth is not alive, but dead."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go
down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of
it.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then the word of the LORD came to Eli'jah the Tishbite, saying,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Sama'ria;
behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take
possession.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And you shall say to him, `Thus says the LORD, "Have you killed,
and also taken possession?"' And you shall say to him, `Thus says the
LORD: "In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs
lick your own blood."'"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Ahab said to Eli'jah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?" He answered,
"I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in
the sight of the LORD.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Behold, I will bring evil upon you; I will utterly sweep you away,
and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and I will make your house like the house of Jerobo'am the son of
Nebat, and like the house of Ba'asha the son of Ahi'jah, for the anger
to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And of Jez'ebel the LORD also said, `The dogs shall eat Jez'ebel
within the bounds of Jezreel.'
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Any one belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat;
and any one of his who dies in the open country the birds of the air
shall eat."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` (There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight
of the LORD like Ahab, whom Jez'ebel his wife incited.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` He did very abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had
done, whom the LORD cast out before the people of Israel.)
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And when Ahab heard those words, he rent his clothes, and put
sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went
about dejectedly.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And the word of the LORD came to Eli'jah the Tishbite, saying,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` "Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he
has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days;
but in his son's days I will bring the evil upon his house."

because of Israel's inheritance law. Naboth's faithfulness to God's Law
contrasts with Ahab's selfish desire and greed, revealing the conflict

21:5-10 - Ahab's wife, Jezebel, plots Naboth's death to satisfy the
king's desire. This evil act of conspiracy and murder highlights the
corruption of power and the wickedness of the human heart (see also
21:17-19 - God sends Elijah to confront Ahab after the murder of
Naboth. Elijah's prophecy against Ahab and Jezebel reveals that no one
is above God's justice, not even the king. This underscores the

incited by Jezebel to commit abominations. His life is an example of
how persistent sin and evil influence can corrupt an entire nation (see
