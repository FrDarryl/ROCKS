be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive
heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon
themselves swift destruction.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` And many will follow their licentiousness, and because of them the
way of truth will be reviled.

"3" = ''':sup:`3` And in their greed they will exploit you with false words; from of

been asleep.

into hell and committed them to pits of nether gloom to be kept until
the judgment;

"5" = ''':sup:`5` if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald
of righteousness, with seven other persons, when he brought a flood
upon the world of the ungodly;

"10" = ''':sup:`10` and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion

unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!

and bringing destruction. Greed is often a motivation for falsehood,
2:4-9 - Peter highlights examples from the Old Testament where God

how to deliver the godly from temptation and punish the unrighteous
2:10-12 - False teachers live arrogantly, disregarding God's authority
and corrupting the truth. Their behavior is compared to irrational
2:13-14 - False teachers live in luxury, deceive the unwary, and are
immersed in evil practices. They pursue temporal pleasures without

corruption. Their deliverance from God is more difficult than that of

6:4-6).
