"1" = ''':sup:`1` For three years Syria and Israel continued without war.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` But in the third year Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah came down to
the king of Israel.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And the king of Israel said to his servants, "Do you know that
Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out
of the hand of the king of Syria?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And he said to Jehosh'aphat, "Will you go with me to battle at
Ramoth-gilead?" And Jehosh'aphat said to the king of Israel, "I am as
you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And Jehosh'aphat said to the king of Israel, "Inquire first for the
word of the LORD."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four
hundred men, and said to them, "Shall I go to battle against
Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear?" And they said, "Go up; for the Lord
will give it into the hand of the king."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But Jehosh'aphat said, "Is there not here another prophet of the
LORD of whom we may inquire?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "There is yet one man
by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micai'ah the son of Imlah; but I
hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil." And
Jehosh'aphat said, "Let not the king say so."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Bring quickly
Micai'ah the son of Imlah."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah were
sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing
floor at the entrance of the gate of Sama'ria; and all the prophets
were prophesying before them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And Zedeki'ah the son of Chena'anah made for himself horns of iron,
and said, "Thus says the LORD, `With these you shall push the Syrians
until they are destroyed.'"
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And all the prophets prophesied so, and said, "Go up to
Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the
king."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the messenger who went to summon Micai'ah said to him, "Behold,
the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king;
let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But Micai'ah said, "As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me,
that I will speak."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micai'ah,
shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?" And he
answered him, "Go up and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand
of the king."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But the king said to him, "How many times shall I adjure you that
you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he said, "I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as
sheep that have no shepherd; and the LORD said, `These have no master;
let each return to his home in peace.'"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "Did I not tell you
that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And Micai'ah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the
LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside
him on his right hand and on his left;
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and
fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said one thing, and another said
another.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, `I
will entice him.'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And the LORD said to him, `By what means?' And he said, `I will go
forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.'
And he said, `You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go forth
and do so.'
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth
of all these your prophets; the LORD has spoken evil concerning you."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then Zedeki'ah the son of Chena'anah came near and struck Micai'ah
on the cheek, and said, "How did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to
speak to you?"
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And Micai'ah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day when you go
into an inner chamber to hide yourself."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And the king of Israel said, "Seize Micai'ah, and take him back to
Amon the governor of the city and to Jo'ash the king's son;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` and say, `Thus says the king, "Put this fellow in prison, and feed
him with scant fare of bread and water, until I come in peace."'"
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And Micai'ah said, "If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken
by me." And he said, "Hear, all you peoples!"
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` So the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah went up to
Ramoth-gilead.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "I will disguise
myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes." And the king of
Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his
chariots, "Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king
of Israel."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehosh'aphat, they said,
"It is surely the king of Israel." So they turned to fight against him;
and Jehosh'aphat cried out.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king
of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of
Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; therefore he said
to the driver of his chariot, "Turn about, and carry me out of the
battle, for I am wounded."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And the battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in
his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died; and the blood
of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And about sunset a cry went through the army, "Every man to his
city, and every man to his country!"
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` So the king died, and was brought to Sama'ria; and they buried the
king in Sama'ria.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And they washed the chariot by the pool of Sama'ria, and the dogs
licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves in it, according
to the word of the LORD which he had spoken.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they
not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahazi'ah his son reigned in his
stead.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Jehosh'aphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth
year of Ahab king of Israel.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Jehosh'aphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was
Azu'bah the daughter of Shilhi.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` He walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside
from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD; yet the high
places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned
incense on the high places.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Jehosh'aphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Now the rest of the acts of Jehosh'aphat, and his might that he
showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the
Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And the remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the
days of his father Asa, he exterminated from the land.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` Jehosh'aphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but
they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at E'zion-ge'ber.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Then Ahazi'ah the son of Ahab said to Jehosh'aphat, "Let my
servants go with your servants in the ships," but Jehosh'aphat was not
willing.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` And Jehosh'aphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David his father; and Jeho'ram his son reigned
in his stead.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Ahazi'ah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Sama'ria in
the seventeenth year of Jehosh'aphat king of Judah, and he reigned two
years over Israel.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of
Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` He served Ba'al and worshiped him, and provoked the LORD, the God
of Israel, to anger in every way that his father had done.

Notas de rodap√©:
22:5-9 - Before going to war against Ramoth-gilead, Jehoshaphat, king
of Judah, asks Ahab to inquire of the word of the Lord. Micaiah, the
true prophet of God, is called, highlighting the importance of seeking
divine guidance before making significant decisions (see also
22:15-18 - Micaiah prophesies Israel's defeat, but Ahab rejects his
message and chooses to follow false prophets. This demonstrates how
refusing to listen to God's truth can lead to destruction (see also
22:19-23 - Micaiah reveals the vision of the heavenly council, where a
lying spirit is sent to deceive Ahab. This vision illustrates God's
sovereign control over all events and God's permissiveness in the face
Thessalonians 2:11-12).
22:29-34 - Despite his precautions, Ahab is mortally wounded in battle,
fulfilling Micaiah's prophecy. This shows that human plans cannot
thwart God's purposes, and God's word always comes true (see also
22:37-40 - Ahab's death and the judgment upon his house are fulfilled
according to the word of the Lord. His reign is marked by idolatry and
disobedience, and his death brings to mind the consequences of sin (see
