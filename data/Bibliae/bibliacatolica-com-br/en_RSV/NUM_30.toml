Notas de rodap√©:
30:1-2 - God establishes the importance of keeping vows made to Him.
Integrity and seriousness in committing to God are fundamental to the
life of faith, and breaking a vow is considered a serious sin (see also
30:3-5 - The law regarding women's vows states that a father or husband
can annul vows made by a daughter or wife. This reflects the
patriarchal system of the time, but also the protection of women under
3:1-6).
30:6-8 - Vows made by a married woman can be annulled by her husband if
he disavows them upon hearing them. This reflects the man's spiritual
authority in the home, according to the practices of the Law of Moses
30:9-12 - Widowed or divorced women, when making vows, are responsible
for fulfilling their promises, since they do not have a male authority
figure over them. This reinforces personal responsibility before God
30:13-16 - The husband has the power to confirm or nullify any vow his
wife makes. The chapter's conclusion emphasizes the established
authority in the family and the accountability of both spouses before
