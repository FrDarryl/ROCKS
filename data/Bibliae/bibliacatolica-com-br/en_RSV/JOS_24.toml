summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel;
and they presented themselves before God.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the LORD, the God of
Israel, `Your fathers lived of old beyond the Euphra'tes, Terah, the
father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him
through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him
Isaac;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country
of Se'ir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in
the midst of it; and afterwards I brought you out.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea;
and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to
the Red Sea.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the
Egyptians, and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your
eyes saw what I did to Egypt; and you lived in the wilderness a long
time.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the
other side of the Jordan; they fought with you, and I gave them into
your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them
before you.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against
Israel; and he sent and invited Balaam the son of Be'or to curse you,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you; so I
delivered you out of his hand.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho, and the men of
Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites, the Per'izzites, the
Canaanites, the Hittites, the Gir'gashites, the Hivites, and the
Jeb'usites; and I gave them into your hand.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you,
the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which
you had not built, and you dwell therein; you eat the fruit of
vineyards and oliveyards which you did not plant.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` "Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
faithfulness; put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the
River, and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And if you be unwilling to serve the LORD, choose this day whom you
will serve, whether the gods your fathers served in the region beyond
the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell; but as
for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then the people answered, "Far be it from us that we should forsake
the LORD, to serve other gods;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our fathers up from
the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and who did those great
signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way that we went, and
among all the peoples through whom we passed;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who
lived in the land; therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our
God."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But Joshua said to the people, "You cannot serve the LORD; for he
is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your
transgressions or your sins.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn
and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the people said to Joshua, "Nay; but we will serve the LORD."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against
yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him." And they said,
"We are witnesses."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` He said, "Then put away the foreign gods which are among you, and
incline your heart to the LORD, the God of Israel."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And the people said to Joshua, "The LORD our God we will serve, and
his voice we will obey."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made
statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he
took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak in the sanctuary
of the LORD.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Joshua said to all the people, "Behold, this stone shall be a
witness against us; for it has heard all the words of the LORD which he
spoke to us; therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal
falsely with your God."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` After these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD,
died, being a hundred and ten years old.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And they buried him in his own inheritance at Tim'nath-se'rah,
which is in the hill country of E'phraim, north of the mountain of
Ga'ash.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days
of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work which the
LORD did for Israel.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` The bones of Joseph which the people of Israel brought up from
Egypt were buried at Shechem, in the portion of ground which Jacob
bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred
pieces of money; it became an inheritance of the descendants of Joseph.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And Elea'zar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at
Gib'e-ah, the town of Phin'ehas his son, which had been given him in
