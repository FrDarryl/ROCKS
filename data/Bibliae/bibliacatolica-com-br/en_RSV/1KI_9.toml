walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all
that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my ordinances,

promised David your father, saying, `There shall not fail you a man

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone passing by it
will be astonished, and will hiss; and they will say, `Why has the LORD
done thus to this land and to this house?'
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then they will say, `Because they forsook the LORD their God who
brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other
gods, and worshiped them and served them; therefore the LORD has
brought all this evil upon them.'"

chariot commanders and his horsemen.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work: five
hundred and fifty, who had charge of the people who carried on the

peace offerings upon the altar which he built to the LORD, burning

Notas de rodap√©:
9:1-3 - God appears to Solomon for the second time after the completion
of the Temple and the palace. He reaffirms His covenant, promising
blessings if Solomon and the people are obedient, but also warning of
the consequences of disobedience. God's faithfulness to His promises
9:4-5 - God promises Solomon that if he and his descendants walk before
Him with integrity of heart and uprightness, as David did, there will
always be a descendant on the throne of Israel. The importance of
obedience to the covenant is central to the prosperity of the kingdom
9:6-9 - God warns that if the people of Israel stray and worship other
gods, the Temple will be destroyed and Israel will become a disgrace
among the nations. This warning illustrates the conditional nature of
God's blessing, depending on the people's faithfulness (see also
9:10-14 - Solomon gives twenty cities in Galilee to Hiram, king of
Tyre, in exchange for his help in building the Temple. However, Hiram
is not pleased with the cities. This episode reflects the diplomatic
aspects of Solomon's reign and his complex political alliances (see
9:26-28 - Solomon establishes a fleet at Ezion Geber, which brings
great wealth to Israel. Solomon's naval success demonstrates his
commercial and economic dominance, strengthening the kingdom through
72:10).
