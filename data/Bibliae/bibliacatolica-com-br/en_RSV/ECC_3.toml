"18" = ''':sup:`18` I said in my heart with regard to the sons of men that God is
testing them to show them that they are but beasts.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For the fate of the sons of men and the fate of beasts is the same;
as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man

3:1-8 - The Preacher presents a famous poem about time, asserting that
there is a time for everything under heaven. Life is composed of
seasons, and each event is under God's sovereignty, illustrating divine

3:9-11 - Although man is aware of time and eternity, he cannot grasp

3:16-17 - The Preacher reflects on the injustice and evil in the world,
