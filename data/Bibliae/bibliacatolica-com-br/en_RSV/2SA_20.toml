"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now there happened to be there a worthless fellow, whose name was
Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite; and he blew the trumpet, and
said, "We have no portion in David, and we have no inheritance in the
son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel!"
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So all the men of Israel withdrew from David, and followed Sheba the
son of Bichri; but the men of Judah followed their king steadfastly
from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten
concubines whom he had left to care for the house, and put them in a
house under guard, and provided for them, but did not go in to them. So
they were shut up until the day of their death, living as if in
widowhood.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then the king said to Ama'sa, "Call the men of Judah together to me
within three days, and be here yourself."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So Ama'sa went to summon Judah; but he delayed beyond the set time
which had been appointed him.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And David said to Abi'shai, "Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us
more harm than Ab'salom; take your lord's servants and pursue him, lest
he get himself fortified cities, and cause us trouble."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And there went out after Abi'shai, Jo'ab and the Cher'ethites and
the Pel'ethites, and all the mighty men; they went out from Jerusalem
to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Ama'sa came to
meet them. Now Jo'ab was wearing a soldier's garment, and over it was a
girdle with a sword in its sheath fastened upon his loins, and as he
went forward it fell out.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Jo'ab said to Ama'sa, "Is it well with you, my brother?" And
Jo'ab took Ama'sa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But Ama'sa did not observe the sword which was in Jo'ab's hand; so
Jo'ab struck him with it in the body, and shed his bowels to the
ground, without striking a second blow; and he died. Then Jo'ab and
Abi'shai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And one of Jo'ab's men took his stand by Ama'sa, and said, "Whoever
favors Jo'ab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Jo'ab."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And Ama'sa lay wallowing in his blood in the highway. And any one
who came by, seeing him, stopped; and when the man saw that all the
people stopped, he carried Ama'sa out of the highway into the field,
and threw a garment over him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When he was taken out of the highway, all the people went on after
Jo'ab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of
Beth-ma'acah; and all the Bichrites assembled, and followed him in.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And all the men who were with Jo'ab came and besieged him in Abel
of Beth-ma'acah; they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood
against the rampart; and they were battering the wall, to throw it
down.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then a wise woman called from the city, "Hear! Hear! Tell Jo'ab,
`Come here, that I may speak to you.'"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he came near her; and the woman said, "Are you Jo'ab?" He
answered, "I am." Then she said to him, "Listen to the words of your
maidservant." And he answered, "I am listening."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then she said, "They were wont to say in old time, `Let them but
ask counsel at Abel'; and so they settled a matter.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel; you
seek to destroy a city which is a mother in Israel; why will you
swallow up the heritage of the LORD?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Jo'ab answered, "Far be it from me, far be it, that I should
swallow up or destroy!
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` That is not true. But a man of the hill country of E'phraim, called
Sheba the son of Bichri, has lifted up his hand against King David;
give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city." And the woman
said to Jo'ab, "Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. And they cut
off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Jo'ab. So
he blew the trumpet, and they dispersed from the city, every man to his
home. And Jo'ab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Now Jo'ab was in command of all the army of Israel; and Benai'ah
the son of Jehoi'ada was in command of the Cher'ethites and the
Pel'ethites;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and Ador'am was in charge of the forced labor; and Jehosh'aphat the
son of Ahi'lud was the recorder;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and Sheva was secretary; and Zadok and Abi'athar were priests;

"26" = ''':sup:`26` and Ira the Ja'irite was also David's priest.
