"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah Hoshe'a the son of Elah
began to reign in Sama'ria over Israel, and he reigned nine years.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, yet not as the
kings of Israel who were before him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Against him came up Shalmane'ser king of Assyria; and Hoshe'a became
his vassal, and paid him tribute.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the king of Assyria found treachery in Hoshe'a; for he had sent
messengers to So, king of Egypt, and offered no tribute to the king of
Assyria, as he had done year by year; therefore the king of Assyria
shut him up, and bound him in prison.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then the king of Assyria invaded all the land and came to Sama'ria,
and for three years he besieged it.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In the ninth year of Hoshe'a the king of Assyria captured Sama'ria,
and he carried the Israelites away to Assyria, and placed them in
Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
Medes.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And this was so, because the people of Israel had sinned against the
LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from
under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and walked in the customs of the nations whom the LORD drove out
before the people of Israel, and in the customs which the kings of
Israel had introduced.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the people of Israel did secretly against the LORD their God
things that were not right. They built for themselves high places at
all their towns, from watchtower to fortified city;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` they set up for themselves pillars and Ashe'rim on every high hill
and under every green tree;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and there they burned incense on all the high places, as the
nations did whom the LORD carried away before them. And they did wicked
things, provoking the LORD to anger,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and they served idols, of which the LORD had said to them, "You
shall not do this."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah by every prophet and every
seer, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my
statutes, in accordance with all the law which I commanded your
fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But they would not listen, but were stubborn, as their fathers had
been, who did not believe in the LORD their God.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They despised his statutes, and his covenant that he made with
their fathers, and the warnings which he gave them. They went after
false idols, and became false, and they followed the nations that were
round about them, concerning whom the LORD had commanded them that they
should not do like them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And they forsook all the commandments of the LORD their God, and
made for themselves molten images of two calves; and they made an
Ashe'rah, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Ba'al.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And they burned their sons and their daughters as offerings, and
used divination and sorcery, and sold themselves to do evil in the
sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out
of his sight; none was left but the tribe of Judah only.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Judah also did not keep the commandments of the LORD their God, but
walked in the customs which Israel had introduced.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel, and afflicted
them, and gave them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them
out of his sight.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When he had torn Israel from the house of David they made Jerobo'am
the son of Nebat king. And Jerobo'am drove Israel from following the
LORD and made them commit great sin.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The people of Israel walked in all the sins which Jerobo'am did;
they did not depart from them,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had spoken by
all his servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their own land
to Assyria until this day.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva,
Hamath, and Sephar-va'im, and placed them in the cities of Sama'ria
instead of the people of Israel; and they took possession of Sama'ria,
and dwelt in its cities.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And at the beginning of their dwelling there, they did not fear the
LORD; therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of
them.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So the king of Assyria was told, "The nations which you have
carried away and placed in the cities of Sama'ria do not know the law
of the god of the land; therefore he has sent lions among them, and
behold, they are killing them, because they do not know the law of the
god of the land."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then the king of Assyria commanded, "Send there one of the priests
whom you carried away thence; and let him go and dwell there, and teach
them the law of the god of the land."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Sama'ria came
and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` But every nation still made gods of its own, and put them in the
shrines of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation
in the cities in which they dwelt;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` the men of Babylon made Suc'coth-be'noth, the men of Cuth made
Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashi'ma,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` and the Av'vites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sephar'vites
burned their children in the fire to Adram'melech and Anam'melech, the
gods of Sephar-va'im.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` They also feared the LORD, and appointed from among themselves all
sorts of people as priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them
in the shrines of the high places.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` So they feared the LORD but also served their own gods, after the
manner of the nations from among whom they had been carried away.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` To this day they do according to the former manner. They do not
fear the LORD, and they do not follow the statutes or the ordinances or
the law or the commandment which the LORD commanded the children of
Jacob, whom he named Israel.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` The LORD made a covenant with them, and commanded them, "You shall
not fear other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or
sacrifice to them;
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` but you shall fear the LORD, who brought you out of the land of
Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm; you shall bow
yourselves to him, and to him you shall sacrifice.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment
which he wrote for you, you shall always be careful to do. You shall
not fear other gods,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` and you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you.
You shall not fear other gods,
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` but you shall fear the LORD your God, and he will deliver you out
of the hand of all your enemies."
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` However they would not listen, but they did according to their
former manner.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` So these nations feared the LORD, and also served their graven
images; their children likewise, and their children's children -- as
their fathers did, so they do to this day.
