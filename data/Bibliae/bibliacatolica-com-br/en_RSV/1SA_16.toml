"1" = ''':sup:`1` The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you grieve over Saul, seeing
I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with
oil, and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have
provided for myself a king among his sons."
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Samuel said, "How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me."
And the LORD said, "Take a heifer with you, and say, `I have come to
sacrifice to the LORD.'
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you
shall do; and you shall anoint for me him whom I name to you."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Samuel did what the LORD commanded, and came to Bethlehem. The
elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, "Do you come
peaceably?"
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And he said, "Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD;
consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice." And he
consecrated Jesse and his sons, and invited them to the sacrifice.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When they came, he looked on Eli'ab and thought, "Surely the LORD'S
anointed is before him."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not look on his appearance or on
the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for the LORD
sees not as man sees; man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD
looks on the heart."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then Jesse called Abin'adab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he
said, "Neither has the LORD chosen this one."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. And he said, "Neither has the LORD
chosen this one."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel
said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen these."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And Samuel said to Jesse, "Are all your sons here?" And he said,
"There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep."
And Samuel said to Jesse, "Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down
till he comes here."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and had
beautiful eyes, and was handsome. And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint
him; for this is he."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of
his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from
that day forward. And Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit
from the LORD tormented him.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And Saul's servants said to him, "Behold now, an evil spirit from
God is tormenting you.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Let our lord now command your servants, who are before you, to seek
out a man who is skilful in playing the lyre; and when the evil spirit
from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Saul said to his servants, "Provide for me a man who can play
well, and bring him to me."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` One of the young men answered, "Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse
the Bethlehemite, who is skilful in playing, a man of valor, a man of
war, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the LORD is
with him."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, "Send me David
your son, who is with the sheep."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a skin of wine and a
kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And David came to Saul, and entered his service. And Saul loved him
greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, "Let David remain in my service,
for he has found favor in my sight."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And whenever the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, David took the
lyre and played it with his hand; so Saul was refreshed, and was well,
and the evil spirit departed from him.
