"1" = ''':sup:`1` Some time after this, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker
offended their lord the king of Egypt.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and
the chief baker,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,
in the prison where Joseph was confined.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he waited on
them; and they continued for some time in custody.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And one night they both dreamed -- the butler and the baker of the
king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison -- each his own dream,
and each dream with its own meaning.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, they were
troubled.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his
master's house, "Why are your faces downcast today?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` They said to him, "We have had dreams, and there is no one to
interpret them." And Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations
belong to God? Tell them to me, I pray you."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In
my dream there was a vine before me,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and on the vine there were three branches; as soon as it budded,
its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed
them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three
branches are three days;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to
your office; and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly,
when you were his butler.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But remember me, when it is well with you, and do me the kindness,
I pray you, to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this
house.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here
also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he
said to Joseph, "I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on
my head,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for
Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And Joseph answered, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets
are three days;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head -- from you! --
and hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat the flesh from you."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for
all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief butler and the
head of the chief baker among his servants.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` He restored the chief butler to his butlership, and he placed the
cup in Pharaoh's hand;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.

Notas de rodap√©:
40:1-4 - Joseph is imprisoned and becomes responsible for the
prisoners. His leadership, even under adverse circumstances,
demonstrates God's sovereignty in his life. Joseph is an example of
integrity and responsibility, even in times of trial (see also
40:5-8 - The dreams of Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker reveal the
importance of dream interpretation in Egyptian culture. Joseph,
trusting in God, offers explanations that highlight his gift and his
37:5-10).
40:9-15 - The interpretation of the cupbearer's dream, which results in
his restoration, shows how God can use difficult situations to further
His will. Joseph also asks the cupbearer to remember him upon his
10:30-31).
40:16-19 - The interpretation of the baker's dream, which predicts his
death, emphasizes the seriousness of divine revelation. This highlights
that not all the results of God's promises are positive, but reflect
12:5).
40:20-23 - The cupbearer forgets Joseph, illustrating the fragility of
human promises. This passage teaches patience and trust in God, even
