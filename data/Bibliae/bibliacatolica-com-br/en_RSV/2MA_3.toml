"1" = ''':sup:`1` While the holy city was inhabited in unbroken peace and the laws
were very well observed because of the piety of the high priest Onias
and his hatred of wickedness,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` it came about that the kings themselves honored the place and
glorified the temple with the finest presents,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` so that even Seleucus, the king of Asia, defrayed from his own
revenues all the expenses connected with the service of the sacrifices.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But a man named Simon, of the tribe of Benjamin, who had been made
captain of the temple, had a disagreement with the high priest about
the administration of the city market;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and when he could not prevail over Onias he went to Apollonius of
Tarsus, who at that time was governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` He reported to him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of untold
sums of money, so that the amount of the funds could not be reckoned,
and that they did not belong to the account of the sacrifices, but that
it was possible for them to fall under the control of the king.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` When Apollonius met the king, he told him of the money about which
he had been informed. The king chose Heliodorus, who was in charge of
his affairs, and sent him with commands to effect the removal of the
aforesaid money.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Heliodorus at once set out on his journey, ostensibly to make a tour
of inspection of the cities of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, but in fact to
carry out the king's purpose.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When he had arrived at Jerusalem and had been kindly welcomed by the
high priest of the city, he told about the disclosure that had been
made and stated why he had come, and he inquired whether this really
was the situation.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The high priest explained that there were some deposits belonging
to widows and orphans,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and also some money of Hyrcanus, son of Tobias, a man of very
prominent position, and that it totaled in all four hundred talents of
silver and two hundred of gold. To such an extent the impious Simon had
misrepresented the facts.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And he said that it was utterly impossible that wrong should be
done to those people who had trusted in the holiness of the place and
in the sanctity and inviolability of the temple which is honored
throughout the whole world.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But Heliodorus, because of the king's commands which he had, said
that this money must in any case be confiscated for the king's
treasury.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So he set a day and went in to direct the inspection of these
funds. There was no little distress throughout the whole city.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` The priests prostrated themselves before the altar in their
priestly garments and called toward heaven upon him who had given the
law about deposits, that he should keep them safe for those who had
deposited them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` To see the appearance of the high priest was to be wounded at
heart, for his face and the change in his color disclosed the anguish
of his soul.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For terror and bodily trembling had come over the man, which
plainly showed to those who looked at him the pain lodged in his heart.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` People also hurried out of their houses in crowds to make a general
supplication because the holy place was about to be brought into
contempt.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Women, girded with sackcloth under their breasts, thronged the
streets. Some of the maidens who were kept indoors ran together to the
gates, and some to the walls, while others peered out of the windows.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And holding up their hands to heaven, they all made entreaty.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` There was something pitiable in the prostration of the whole
populace and the anxiety of the high priest in his great anguish.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` While they were calling upon the Almighty Lord that he would keep
what had been entrusted safe and secure for those who had entrusted it,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Heliodorus went on with what had been decided.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` But when he arrived at the treasury with his bodyguard, then and
there the Sovereign of spirits and of all authority caused so great a
manifestation that all who had been so bold as to accompany him were
astounded by the power of God, and became faint with terror.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For there appeared to them a magnificently caparisoned horse, with
a rider of frightening mien, and it rushed furiously at Heliodorus and
struck at him with its front hoofs. Its rider was seen to have armor
and weapons of gold.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Two young men also appeared to him, remarkably strong, gloriously
beautiful and splendidly dressed, who stood on each side of him and
scourged him continuously, inflicting many blows on him.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When he suddenly fell to the ground and deep darkness came over
him, his men took him up and put him on a stretcher
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and carried him away, this man who had just entered the aforesaid
treasury with a great retinue and all his bodyguard but was now unable
to help himself; and they recognized clearly the sovereign power of
God.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` While he lay prostrate, speechless because of the divine
intervention and deprived of any hope of recovery,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` they praised the Lord who had acted marvelously for his own place.
And the temple, which a little while before was full of fear and
disturbance, was filled with joy and gladness, now that the Almighty
Lord had appeared.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Quickly some of Heliodorus' friends asked Onias to call upon the
Most High and to grant life to one who was lying quite at his last
breath.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And the high priest, fearing that the king might get the notion
that some foul play had been perpetrated by the Jews with regard to
Heliodorus, offered sacrifice for the man's recovery.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` While the high priest was making the offering of atonement, the
same young men appeared again to Heliodorus dressed in the same
clothing, and they stood and said, "Be very grateful to Onias the high
priest, since for his sake the Lord has granted you your life.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And see that you, who have been scourged by heaven, report to all
men the majestic power of God." Having said this they vanished.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Then Heliodorus offered sacrifice to the Lord and made very great
vows to the Savior of his life, and having bidden Onias farewell, he
marched off with his forces to the king.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And he bore testimony to all men of the deeds of the supreme God,
which he had seen with his own eyes.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` When the king asked Heliodorus what sort of person would be
suitable to send on another mission to Jerusalem, he replied,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` "If you have any enemy or plotter against your government, send him
there, for you will get him back thoroughly scourged, if he escapes at
all, for there certainly is about the place some power of God.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` For he who has his dwelling in heaven watches over that place
himself and brings it aid, and he strikes and destroys those who come
to do it injury."
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` This was the outcome of the episode of Heliodorus and the
protection of the treasury.
