"1" = ''':sup:`1` Not long after this, the king sent an Athenian senator to compel the
Jews to forsake the laws of their fathers and cease to live by the laws
of God,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and also to pollute the temple in Jerusalem and call it the temple
of Olympian Zeus, and to call the one in Gerizim the temple of Zeus the
Friend of Strangers, as did the people who dwelt in that place.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Harsh and utterly grievous was the onslaught of evil.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For the temple was filled with debauchery and reveling by the
Gentiles, who dallied with harlots and had intercourse with women
within the sacred precincts, and besides brought in things for
sacrifice that were unfit.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The altar was covered with abominable offerings which were forbidden
by the laws.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` A man could neither keep the sabbath, nor observe the feasts of his
fathers, nor so much as confess himself to be a Jew.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` On the monthly celebration of the king's birthday, the Jews were
taken, under bitter constraint, to partake of the sacrifices; and when
the feast of Dionysus came, they were compelled to walk in the
procession in honor of Dionysus, wearing wreaths of ivy.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` At the suggestion of Ptolemy a decree was issued to the neighboring
Greek cities, that they should adopt the same policy toward the Jews
and make them partake of the sacrifices,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and should slay those who did not choose to change over to Greek
customs. One could see, therefore, the misery that had come upon them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For example, two women were brought in for having circumcised their
children. These women they publicly paraded about the city, with their
babies hung at their breasts, then hurled them down headlong from the
wall.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Others who had assembled in the caves near by, to observe the
seventh day secretly, were betrayed to Philip and were all burned
together, because their piety kept them from defending themselves, in
view of their regard for that most holy day.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now I urge those who read this book not to be depressed by such
calamities, but to recognize that these punishments were designed not
to destroy but to discipline our people.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In fact, not to let the impious alone for long, but to punish them
immediately, is a sign of great kindness.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For in the case of the other nations the Lord waits patiently to
punish them until they have reached the full measure of their sins; but
he does not deal in this way with us,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` in order that he may not take vengeance on us afterward when our
sins have reached their height.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Therefore he never withdraws his mercy from us. Though he
disciplines us with calamities, he does not forsake his own people.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Let what we have said serve as a reminder; we must go on briefly
with the story.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Eleazar, one of the scribes in high position, a man now advanced in
age and of noble presence, was being forced to open his mouth to eat
swine's flesh.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` But he, welcoming death with honor rather than life with pollution,
went up to the the rack of his own accord, spitting out the flesh,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` as men ought to go who have the courage to refuse things that it is
not right to taste, even for the natural love of life.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Those who were in charge of that unlawful sacrifice took the man
aside, because of their long acquaintance with him, and privately urged
him to bring meat of his own providing, proper for him to use, and
pretend that he was eating the flesh of the sacrificial meal which had
been commanded by the king,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` so that by doing this he might be saved from death, and be treated
kindly on account of his old friendship with them.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But making a high resolve, worthy of his years and the dignity of
his old age and the gray hairs which he had reached with distinction
and his excellent life even from childhood, and moreover according to
the holy God-given law, he declared himself quickly, telling them to
send him to Hades.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "Such pretense is not worthy of our time of life," he said, "lest
many of the young should suppose that Eleazar in his ninetieth year has
gone over to an alien religion,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` and through my pretense, for the sake of living a brief moment
longer, they should be led astray because of me, while I defile and
disgrace my old age.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For even if for the present I should avoid the punishment of men,
yet whether I live or die I shall not escape the hands of the Almighty.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Therefore, by manfully giving up my life now, I will show myself
worthy of my old age
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` and leave to the young a noble example of how to die a good death
willingly and nobly for the revered and holy laws." When he had said
this, he went at once to the rack.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And those who a little before had acted toward him with good will
now changed to ill will, because the words he had uttered were in their
opinion sheer madness.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When he was about to die under the blows, he groaned aloud and
said: "It is clear to the Lord in his holy knowledge that, though I
might have been saved from death, I am enduring terrible sufferings in
my body under this beating, but in my soul I am glad to suffer these
things because I fear him."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So in this way he died, leaving in his death an example of nobility
and a memorial of courage, not only to the young but to the great body
of his nation.
