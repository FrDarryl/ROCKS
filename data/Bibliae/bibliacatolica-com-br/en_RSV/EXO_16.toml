"1" = ''':sup:`1` They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of the people of
Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai,
on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had departed from
the land of Egypt.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And the whole congregation of the people of Israel murmured against
Moses and Aaron in the wilderness,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and said to them, "Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in
the land of Egypt, when we sat by the fleshpots and ate bread to the
full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this
whole assembly with hunger."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Then the LORD said to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven
for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every
day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law or not.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be
twice as much as they gather daily."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, "At evening you
shall know that it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of
Egypt,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and in the morning you shall see the glory of the LORD, because he
has heard your murmurings against the LORD. For what are we, that you
murmur against us?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And Moses said, "When the LORD gives you in the evening flesh to eat
and in the morning bread to the full, because the LORD has heard your
murmurings which you murmur against him -- what are we? Your murmurings
are not against us but against the LORD."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Moses said to Aaron, "Say to the whole congregation of the
people of Israel, `Come near before the LORD, for he has heard your
murmurings.'"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of
Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the
LORD appeared in the cloud.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And the LORD said to Moses,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` "I have heard the murmurings of the people of Israel; say to them,
`At twilight you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be
filled with bread; then you shall know that I am the LORD your God.'"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In the evening quails came up and covered the camp; and in the
morning dew lay round about the camp.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when the dew had gone up, there was on the face of the
wilderness a fine, flake-like thing, fine as hoarfrost on the ground.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When the people of Israel saw it, they said to one another, "What
is it?" For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, "It
is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` This is what the LORD has commanded: `Gather of it, every man of
you, as much as he can eat; you shall take an omer apiece, according to
the number of the persons whom each of you has in his tent.'"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the people of Israel did so; they gathered, some more, some
less.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had
nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; each gathered
according to what he could eat.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And Moses said to them, "Let no man leave any of it till the
morning."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But they did not listen to Moses; some left part of it till the
morning, and it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with
them.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Morning by morning they gathered it, each as much as he could eat;
but when the sun grew hot, it melted.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers
apiece; and when all the leaders of the congregation came and told
Moses,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` he said to them, "This is what the LORD has commanded: `Tomorrow is
a day of solemn rest, a holy sabbath to the LORD; bake what you will
bake and boil what you will boil, and all that is left over lay by to
be kept till the morning.'"
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So they laid it by till the morning, as Moses bade them; and it did
not become foul, and there were no worms in it.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Moses said, "Eat it today, for today is a sabbath to the LORD;
today you will not find it in the field.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is a
sabbath, there will be none."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, and they
found none.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And the LORD said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep my
commandments and my laws?
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` See! The LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore on the sixth day
he gives you bread for two days; remain every man of you in his place,
let no man go out of his place on the seventh day."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So the people rested on the seventh day.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Now the house of Israel called its name manna; it was like
coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with
honey.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded: `Let an omer
of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread
with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the
land of Egypt.'"
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar, and put an omer of manna in
it, and place it before the LORD, to be kept throughout your
generations."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron placed it before the
testimony, to be kept.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And the people of Israel ate the manna forty years, till they came
to a habitable land; they ate the manna, till they came to the border
of the land of Canaan.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` (An omer is the tenth part of an ephah.)
