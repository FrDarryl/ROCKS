[32]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and when Jacob saw them he said, "This is God's army!" So he called
the name of that place Mahana'im.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land
of Se'ir, the country of Edom,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` instructing them, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says
your servant Jacob, `I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and I have oxen, asses, flocks, menservants, and maidservants; and I
have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your
sight.'"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your
brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with
him."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the
people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into
two companies,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` thinking, "If Esau comes to the one company and destroys it, then
the company which is left will escape."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father
Isaac, O LORD who didst say to me, `Return to your country and to your
kindred, and I will do you good,'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I am not worthy of the least of all the steadfast love and all the
faithfulness which thou hast shown to thy servant, for with only my
staff I crossed this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand
of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and slay us all, the mothers with
the children.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But thou didst say, `I will do you good, and make your descendants
as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So he lodged there that night, and took from what he had with him a
present for his brother Esau,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and
twenty rams,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls,
twenty she-asses and ten he-asses.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` These he delivered into the hand of his servants, every drove by
itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on before me, and put a space
between drove and drove."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He instructed the foremost, "When Esau my brother meets you, and
asks you, `To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are
these before you?'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` then you shall say, `They belong to your servant Jacob; they are a
present sent to my lord Esau; and moreover he is behind us.'"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who
followed the droves, "You shall say the same thing to Esau when you
meet him,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and you shall say, `Moreover your servant Jacob is behind us.'" For
he thought, "I may appease him with the present that goes before me,
and afterwards I shall see his face; perhaps he will accept me."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So the present passed on before him; and he himself lodged that
night in the camp.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two maids, and
his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` He took them and sent them across the stream, and likewise
everything that he had.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him until the
breaking of the day.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched
the hollow of his thigh; and Jacob's thigh was put out of joint as he
wrestled with him.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then he said, "Let me go, for the day is breaking." But Jacob said,
"I will not let you go, unless you bless me."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then he said, "Your name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel,
for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then Jacob asked him, "Tell me, I pray, your name." But he said,
"Why is it that you ask my name?" And there he blessed him.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` So Jacob called the name of the place Peni'el, saying, "For I have
seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` The sun rose upon him as he passed Penu'el, limping because of his
thigh.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the
hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, because he touched the
hollow of Jacob's thigh on the sinew of the hip.
