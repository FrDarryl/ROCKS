"1" = ''':sup:`1` When all the kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan to
the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites that were by the sea,
heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the
people of Israel until they had crossed over, their heart melted, and
there was no longer any spirit in them, because of the people of
Israel.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and
circumcise the people of Israel again the second time."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So Joshua made flint knives, and circumcised the people of Israel at
Gibeath-haaraloth.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of
the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died on the
way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the
people that were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come
out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till
all the nation, the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, perished,
because they did not hearken to the voice of the LORD; to them the LORD
swore that he would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn
to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So it was their children, whom he raised up in their stead, that
Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not
been circumcised on the way.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When the circumcising of all the nation was done, they remained in
their places in the camp till they were healed.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the LORD said to Joshua, "This day I have rolled away the
reproach of Egypt from you." And so the name of that place is called
Gilgal to this day.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` While the people of Israel were encamped in Gilgal they kept the
passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of
Jericho.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And on the morrow after the passover, on that very day, they ate of
the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they ate of the produce of
the land; and the people of Israel had manna no more, but ate of the
fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and
behold, a man stood before him with his drawn sword in his hand; and
Joshua went to him and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our
adversaries?"
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he said, "No; but as commander of the army of the LORD I have
now come." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and
said to him, "What does my lord bid his servant?"
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And the commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, "Put off your
shoes from your feet; for the place where you stand is holy." And
Joshua did so.
