"1" = ''':sup:`1` Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus,
and our brother Sos'thenes,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those sanctified in
Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every
place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and
ours:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I give thanks to God always for you because of the grace of God
which was given you in Christ Jesus,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` that in every way you were enriched in him with all speech and all
knowledge --
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` even as the testimony to Christ was confirmed among you --
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for
the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his
Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that all of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you, but
that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For it has been reported to me by Chlo'e's people that there is
quarreling among you, my brethren.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` What I mean is that each one of you says, "I belong to Paul," or "I
belong to Apol'los," or "I belong to Cephas," or "I belong to Christ."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized
in the name of Paul?
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I am thankful that I baptized none of you except Crispus and
Ga'ius;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` lest any one should say that you were baptized in my name.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` (I did baptize also the household of Steph'anas. Beyond that, I do
not know whether I baptized any one else.)
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and
not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its
power.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but
to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the
cleverness of the clever I will thwart."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of
this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through
wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save
those who believe.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly
to Gentiles,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power
of God and the wisdom of God.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of
God is stronger than men.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise
according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were
of noble birth;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God
chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong,
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that
are not, to bring to nothing things that are,
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, whom God made our
wisdom, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` therefore, as it is written, "Let him who boasts, boast of the
Lord."

Notas de rodap√©:
1:10-13 - Paul calls for unity in the church, warning against divisions
caused by loyalty to human leaders. True unity comes from Christ, not
1:18-21 - The message of the cross is foolishness to the wise of this
world, but it is the power of God to those who are saved. This contrast
between human and divine wisdom is central to understanding the gospel
1:26-29 - God chose the weak and the humble to confound the wise and
the mighty, emphasizing that salvation does not come by human wisdom
1:30-31 - Christ is our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
redemption. Salvation is an act of God, not something we can earn, and
it is given to those who humble themselves before His grace (see also
