Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of
David.

and commander." And Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah went up first, so he
became chief.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` And David dwelt in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city
of David.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he built the city round about from the Millo in complete

Dodo, the Aho'hite.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` He was with David at Pas-dam'mim when the Philistines were gathered

"14" = ''':sup:`14` But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, and defended it,
and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great victory.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the
cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the

Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And David said longingly, "O that some one would give me water to
drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the
Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem which was by
the gate, and took and brought it to David. But David would not drink
of it; he poured it out to the LORD,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` and said, "Far be it from me before my God that I should do this.
Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their
lives they brought it." Therefore he would not drink it. These things
did the three mighty men.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now Abi'shai, the brother of Jo'ab, was chief of the thirty. And he
wielded his spear against three hundred men and slew them, and won a

slew a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall.
The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver's beam; but Benai'ah

Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
