"1" = ''':sup:`1` Therefore you have no excuse, O man, whoever you are, when you judge
another; for in passing judgment upon him you condemn yourself, because
you, the judge, are doing the very same things.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` We know that the judgment of God rightly falls upon those who do
such things.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Do you suppose, O man, that when you judge those who do such things
and yet do them yourself, you will escape the judgment of God?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Or do you presume upon the riches of his kindness and forbearance
and patience? Do you not know that God's kindness is meant to lead you
to repentance?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for
yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be
revealed.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For he will render to every man according to his works:
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and
immortality, he will give eternal life;
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey
wickedness, there will be wrath and fury.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who
does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew
first and also the Greek.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For God shows no partiality.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` All who have sinned without the law will also perish without the
law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God,
but the doers of the law who will be justified.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law
requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have
the law.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts,
while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting
thoughts accuse or perhaps excuse them
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of
men by Christ Jesus.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But if you call yourself a Jew and rely upon the law and boast of
your relation to God

"18" = ''':sup:`18` and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are
instructed in the law,

those who are in darkness,

law the embodiment of knowledge and truth --
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` you then who teach others, will you not teach yourself? While you
preach against stealing, do you steal?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit
adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For, as it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the
Gentiles because of you."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law; but if you
break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law,
will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then those who are physically uncircumcised but keep the law will
condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the
law.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true
circumcision something external and physical.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` He is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter
of the heart, spiritual and not literal. His praise is not from men but
from God.
