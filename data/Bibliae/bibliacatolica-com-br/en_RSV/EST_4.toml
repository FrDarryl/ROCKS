"1" = ''':sup:`1` When Mor'decai learned all that had been done, Mor'decai rent his
clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of
the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` he went up to the entrance of the king's gate, for no one might
enter the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And in every province, wherever the king's command and his decree
came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping
and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was
deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mor'decai, so that he
might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had
been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mor'decai to
learn what this was and why it was.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Hathach went out to Mor'decai in the open square of the city in
front of the king's gate,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and Mor'decai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact
sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries
for the destruction of the Jews.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Mor'decai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa
for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it
to her and charge her to go to the king to make supplication to him and
entreat him for her people.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Hathach went and told Esther what Mor'decai had said.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then Esther spoke to Hathach and gave him a message for Mor'decai,
saying,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces
know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court
without being called, there is but one law; all alike are to be put to
death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter
that he may live. And I have not been called to come in to the king
these thirty days."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And they told Mor'decai what Esther had said.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Mor'decai told them to return answer to Esther, "Think not
that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other
Jews.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and
deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and
your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not
come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then Esther told them to reply to Mor'decai,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my
behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and
my maids will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though
it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish."

"17" = ''':sup:`17` Mor'decai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered
him.
