the priest, the son of Ma-asei'ah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,

who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from
Jerusalem.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet:
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` "Thus says the LORD, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king
of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me, `Behold, Pharaoh's army

'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now when the Chalde'an army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the
approach of Pharaoh's army,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to
receive his portion there among the people.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Iri'jah the
son of Shelemi'ah, son of Hanani'ah, seized Jeremiah the prophet,
saying, "You are deserting to the Chalde'ans."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Jeremiah said, "It is false; I am not deserting to the
Chalde'ans." But Iri'jah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah

'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And the princes were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and
imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been
made a prison.

"16" = ''':sup:`16` When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells, and remained there
many days,

"17" = ''':sup:`17` King Zedeki'ah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned
him secretly in his house, and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?"
Jeremiah said, "There is." Then he said, "You shall be delivered into
the hand of the king of Babylon."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Jeremiah also said to King Zedeki'ah, "What wrong have I done to
you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, `The king of
Babylon will not come against you and against this land'?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Now hear, I pray you, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come
before you, and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the
secretary, lest I die there."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So King Zedeki'ah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the
court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the
bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah
remained in the court of the guard.
