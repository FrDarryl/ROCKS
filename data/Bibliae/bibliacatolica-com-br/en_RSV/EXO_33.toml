whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which
I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, `To your descendants I
will give it.'
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the
Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Per'izzites, the Hivites,
and the Jeb'usites.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up
among you, lest I consume you in the way, for you are a stiff-necked
people."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned; and no man
put on his ornaments.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For the LORD had said to Moses, "Say to the people of Israel, `You
are a stiff-necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among
you, I would consume you. So now put off your ornaments from you, that
I may know what to do with you.'"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Therefore the people of Israel stripped themselves of their
ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far
off from the camp; and he called it the tent of meeting. And every one
who sought the LORD would go out to the tent of meeting, which was
outside the camp.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose up, and
every man stood at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he had
gone into the tent.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and
stand at the door of the tent, and the LORD would speak with Moses.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And when all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the
door of the tent, all the people would rise up and worship, every man
at his tent door.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Thus the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks
to his friend. When Moses turned again into the camp, his servant
Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, did not depart from the tent.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Moses said to the LORD, "See, thou sayest to me, `Bring up this
people'; but thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet
thou hast said, `I know you by name, and you have also found favor in
my sight.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight,
show me now thy ways, that I may know thee and find favor in thy sight.
Consider too that this nation is thy people."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you
rest."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he said to him, "If thy presence will not go with me, do not
carry us up from here.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For how shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I
and thy people? Is it not in thy going with us, so that we are
distinct, I and thy people, from all other people that are upon the
face of the earth?"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And the LORD said to Moses, "This very thing that you have spoken I
will do; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Moses said, "I pray thee, show me thy glory."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will
proclaim before you my name `The LORD'; and I will be gracious to whom
I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But," he said, "you cannot see my face; for man shall not see me
and live."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the LORD said, "Behold, there is a place by me where you shall
stand upon the rock;
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock,
and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back; but my
face shall not be seen."
