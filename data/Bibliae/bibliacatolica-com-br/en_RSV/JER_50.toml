"42" = ''':sup:`42` They lay hold of bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy.
The sound of them is like the roaring of the sea; they ride upon
horses, arrayed as a man for battle against you, O daughter of Babylon!

Chalde'ans: Surely the little ones of their flock shall be dragged
away; surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate.
