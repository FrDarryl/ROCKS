"2" = ''':sup:`2` a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and thick darkness!
Like blackness there is spread upon the mountains a great and powerful
people; their like has never been from of old, nor will be again after
them through the years of all generations.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Fire devours before them, and behind them a flame burns. The land is
like the garden of Eden before them, but after them a desolate
wilderness, and nothing escapes them.

horses they run.

moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.

of the LORD is great and very terrible; who can endure it?

with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning;

"13" = ''':sup:`13` and rend your hearts and not your garments." Return to the LORD,
your God, for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding
in steadfast love, and repents of evil.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Who knows whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing
behind him, a cereal offering and a drink offering for the LORD, your
God?
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Blow the trumpet in Zion; sanctify a fast; call a solemn assembly;

room, and the bride her chamber.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Between the vestibule and the altar let the priests, the ministers
of the LORD, weep and say, "Spare thy people, O LORD, and make not thy

people.

make you a reproach among the nations.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` "I will remove the northerner far from you, and drive him into a
parched and desolate land, his front into the eastern sea, and his rear
into the western sea; the stench and foul smell of him will rise, for
he has done great things.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice, for the LORD has done great
things!
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Fear not, you beasts of the field, for the pastures of the
wilderness are green; the tree bears its fruit, the fig tree and vine
give their full yield.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "Be glad, O sons of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD, your God; for he
has given the early rain for your vindication, he has poured down for
you abundant rain, the early and the latter rain, as before.

overflow with wine and oil.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` I will restore to you the years which the swarming locust has
eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which
I sent among you.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` "You shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of
the LORD your God, who has dealt wondrously with you. And my people
shall never again be put to shame.

"27" = ''':sup:`27` You shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I, the
LORD, am your God and there is none else. And my people shall never
again be put to shame.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` "And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my
spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your
old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
