"2" = ''':sup:`2` "I know that thou canst do all things, and that no purpose of thine
can be thwarted.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` `Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you declare to
me.'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees
thee;

"6" = ''':sup:`6` therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to
Eli'phaz the Te'manite: "My wrath is kindled against you and against
your two friends; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my
servant Job has.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant
Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job
shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you

him before, and ate bread with him in his house; and they showed him
sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought
upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a ring of
gold.

beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a
thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he called the name of the first Jemi'mah; and the name of the
second Kezi'ah; and the name of the third Ker'en-hap'puch.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` And in all the land there were no women so fair as Job's daughters;
