"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now when it was reported to Sanbal'lat and Tobi'ah and to Geshem the
Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that
there was no breach left in it (although up to that time I had not set
up the doors in the gates),
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Sanbal'lat and Geshem sent to me, saying, "Come and let us meet
together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono." But they intended
to do me harm.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and
I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come
down to you?"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And they sent to me four times in this way and I answered them in
the same manner.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` In the same way Sanbal'lat for the fifth time sent his servant to me
with an open letter in his hand.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In it was written, "It is reported among the nations, and Geshem
also says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you
are building the wall; and you wish to become their king, according to
this report.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in
Jerusalem, `There is a king in Judah.' And now it will be reported to
the king according to these words. So now come, and let us take counsel
together."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then I sent to him, saying, "No such things as you say have been
done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will drop
from the work, and it will not be done." But now, O God, strengthen
thou my hands.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now when I went into the house of Shemai'ah the son of Delai'ah,
son of Mehet'abel, who was shut up, he said, "Let us meet together in
the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the
temple; for they are coming to kill you, at night they are coming to
kill you."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But I said, "Should such a man as I flee? And what man such as I
could go into the temple and live? I will not go in."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And I understood, and saw that God had not sent him, but he had
pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobi'ah and Sanbal'lat had
hired him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For this purpose he was hired, that I should be afraid and act in
this way and sin, and so they could give me an evil name, in order to
taunt me.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Remember Tobi'ah and Sanbal'lat, O my God, according to these
things that they did, and also the prophetess No-adi'ah and the rest of
the prophets who wanted to make me afraid.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul,
in fifty-two days.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about
us were afraid and fell greatly in their own esteem; for they perceived
that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to
Tobi'ah, and Tobi'ah's letters came to them.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the
son-in-law of Shecani'ah the son of Arah: and his son Jehoha'nan had
taken the daughter of Meshul'lam the son of Berechi'ah as his wife.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence, and reported my
words to him. And Tobi'ah sent letters to make me afraid.
