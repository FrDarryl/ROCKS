"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, but he was the son
of a harlot. Gilead was the father of Jephthah.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Gilead's wife also bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew
up, they thrust Jephthah out, and said to him, "You shall not inherit
in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and dwelt in the land of Tob;
and worthless fellows collected round Jephthah, and went raiding with
him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead
went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and they said to Jephthah, "Come and be our leader, that we may
fight with the Ammonites."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "Did you not hate me, and
drive me out of my father's house? Why have you come to me now when you
are in trouble?"
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "That is why we have
turned to you now, that you may go with us and fight with the
Ammonites, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, "If you bring me home again
to fight with the Ammonites, and the LORD gives them over to me, I will
be your head."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "The LORD will be
witness between us; we will surely do as you say."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him
head and leader over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the
LORD at Mizpah.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites and
said, "What have you against me, that you have come to me to fight
against my land?"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah,
"Because Israel on coming from Egypt took away my land, from the Arnon
to the Jabbok and to the Jordan; now therefore restore it peaceably."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and said to him, "Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the
land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` but when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the
wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, `Let us
pass, we pray, through your land'; but the king of Edom would not
listen. And they sent also to the king of Moab, but he would not
consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then they journeyed through the wilderness, and went around the
land of Edom and the land of Moab, and arrived on the east side of the
land of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon; but they did
not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of
Moab.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Israel then sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of
Heshbon; and Israel said to him, `Let us pass, we pray, through your
land to our country.'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so
Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped at Jahaz, and
fought with Israel.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` And the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into
the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; so Israel took possession
of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from
the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So then the LORD, the God of Israel, dispossessed the Amorites from
before his people Israel; and are you to take possession of them?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Will you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess?
And all that the LORD our God has dispossessed before us, we will
possess.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab?
Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever go to war with them?
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aro'er and
its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon,
three hundred years, why did you not recover them within that time?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` I therefore have not sinned against you, and you do me wrong by
making war on me; the LORD, the Judge, decide this day between the
people of Israel and the people of Ammon."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But the king of the Ammonites did not heed the message of Jephthah
which he sent to him.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
through Gilead and Manas'seh, and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and
from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD, and said, "If thou wilt give
the Ammonites into my hand,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` then whoever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me,
when I return victorious from the Ammonites, shall be the LORD's, and I
will offer him up for a burnt offering."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them;
and the LORD gave them into his hand.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And he smote them from Aro'er to the neighborhood of Minnith,
twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with a very great slaughter.
So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah; and behold, his daughter
came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances; she was his only
child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And when he saw her, he rent his clothes, and said, "Alas, my
daughter! you have brought me very low, and you have become the cause
of great trouble to me; for I have opened my mouth to the LORD, and I
cannot take back my vow."
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And she said to him, "My father, if you have opened your mouth to
the LORD, do to me according to what has gone forth from your mouth,
now that the LORD has avenged you on your enemies, on the Ammonites."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me; let me
alone two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains, and bewail
my virginity, I and my companions."
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And he said, "Go." And he sent her away for two months; and she
departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
mountains.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did
with her according to his vow which he had made. She had never known a
man. And it became a custom in Israel
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` that the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the
daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.
