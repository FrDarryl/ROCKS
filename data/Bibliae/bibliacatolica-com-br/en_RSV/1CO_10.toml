"1" = ''':sup:`1` I want you to know, brethren, that our fathers were all under the
cloud, and all passed through the sea,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and all ate the same supernatural food
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and all drank the same supernatural drink. For they drank from the
supernatural Rock which followed them, and the Rock was Christ.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Nevertheless with most of them God was not pleased; for they were
overthrown in the wilderness.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Now these things are warnings for us, not to desire evil as they
did.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, "The
people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to dance."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` We must not indulge in immorality as some of them did, and
twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` We must not put the Lord to the test, as some of them did and were
destroyed by serpents;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the
Destroyer.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now these things happened to them as a warning, but they were
written down for our instruction, upon whom the end of the ages has
come.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Therefore let any one who thinks that he stands take heed lest he
fall.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is
faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your strength, but
with the temptation will also provide the way of escape, that you may
be able to endure it.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Therefore, my beloved, shun the worship of idols.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` I speak as to sensible men; judge for yourselves what I say.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in
the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a
participation in the body of Christ?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we
all partake of the one bread.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Consider the people of Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices
partners in the altar?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or
that an idol is anything?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not
to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You
cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "All things are lawful," but not all things are helpful. "All
things are lawful," but not all things build up.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any
question on the ground of conscience.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For "the earth is the Lord's, and everything in it."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are
disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any
question on the ground of conscience.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` (But if some one says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice,"
then out of consideration for the man who informed you, and for
conscience' sake --
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` I mean his conscience, not yours -- do not eat it.) For why should
my liberty be determined by another man's scruples?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that
for which I give thanks?
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the
glory of God.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` just as I try to please all men in everything I do, not seeking my
own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.
