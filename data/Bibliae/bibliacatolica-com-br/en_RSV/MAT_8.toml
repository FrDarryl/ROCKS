"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be
clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` And Jesus said to him, "See that you say nothing to any one; but go,
show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded,
for a proof to the people."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` As he entered Caper'na-um, a centurion came forward to him,
beseeching him
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in
terrible distress."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And he said to him, "I will come and heal him."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But the centurion answered him, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you
come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be
healed.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to

slave, `Do this,' and he does it."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed

'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer
darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And to the centurion Jesus said, "Go; be it done for you as you
have believed." And the servant was healed at that very moment.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law
lying sick with a fever;
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and
served him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` That evening they brought to him many who were possessed with
demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who
were sick.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, "He took
our infirmities and bore our diseases."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go
over to the other side.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you
wherever you go."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have
nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and
bury my father."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their
own dead."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat
was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And they went and woke him, saying, "Save, Lord; we are perishing."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And he said to them, "Why are you afraid, O men of little faith?"
Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great
calm.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And the men marveled, saying, "What sort of man is this, that even
winds and sea obey him?"
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And when he came to the other side, to the country of the
Gadarenes, two demoniacs met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce
that no one could pass that way.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O Son of
God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And the demons begged him, "If you cast us out, send us away into
the herd of swine."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And he said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the
swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the
sea, and perished in the waters.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything,
and what had happened to the demoniacs.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw
him, they begged him to leave their neighborhood.
