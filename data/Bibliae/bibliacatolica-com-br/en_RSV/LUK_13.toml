"1" = ''':sup:`1` There were some present at that very time who told him of the
Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse
sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered thus?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` I tell you, No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Silo'am fell and killed
them, do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others
who dwelt in Jerusalem?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I tell you, No; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he told this parable: "A man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And he said to the vinedresser, `Lo, these three years I have come
seeking fruit on this fig tree, and I find none. Cut it down; why
should it use up the ground?'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And he answered him, `Let it alone, sir, this year also, till I dig
about it and put on manure.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And if it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can
cut it down.'"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for
eighteen years; she was bent over and could not fully straighten
herself.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And when Jesus saw her, he called her and said to her, "Woman, you
are freed from your infirmity."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And he laid his hands upon her, and immediately she was made
straight, and she praised God.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed
on the sabbath, said to the people, "There are six days on which work
ought to be done; come on those days and be healed, and not on the
sabbath day."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then the Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Does not each of you
on the sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger, and lead it
away to water it?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan bound
for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` As he said this, all his adversaries were put to shame; and all the
people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` He said therefore, "What is the kingdom of God like? And to what
shall I compare it?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in
his garden; and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air
made nests in its branches."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And again he said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of
flour, till it was all leavened."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching, and
journeying toward Jerusalem.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And some one said to him, "Lord, will those who are saved be few?"
And he said to them,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "Strive to enter by the narrow door; for many, I tell you, will
seek to enter and will not be able.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` When once the householder has risen up and shut the door, you will
begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, `Lord, open to
us.' He will answer you, `I do not know where you come from.'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then you will begin to say, `We ate and drank in your presence, and
you taught in our streets.'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But he will say, `I tell you, I do not know where you come from;
depart from me, all you workers of iniquity!'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` There you will weep and gnash your teeth, when you see Abraham and
Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you
yourselves thrust out.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And men will come from east and west, and from north and south, and
sit at table in the kingdom of God.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who
will be last."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` At that very hour some Pharisees came, and said to him, "Get away
from here, for Herod wants to kill you."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And he said to them, "Go and tell that fox, `Behold, I cast out
demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish
my course.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the day
following; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from
Jerusalem.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets and stoning those who
are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together
as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Behold, your house is forsaken. And I tell you, you will not see me
until you say, `Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!'"
