"1" = ''':sup:`1` Thus said the LORD to me, "Go and buy a linen waistcloth, and put it
on your loins, and do not dip it in water."

it on my loins.

loins, and arise, go to the Euphra'tes, and hide it there in a cleft of
the rock."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So I went, and hid it by the Euphra'tes, as the LORD commanded me.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And after many days the LORD said to me, "Arise, go to the
Euphra'tes, and take from there the waistcloth which I commanded you to
hide there."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then I went to the Euphra'tes, and dug, and I took the waistcloth
from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the waistcloth was
spoiled; it was good for nothing.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then the word of the LORD came to me:
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "Thus says the LORD: Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the
great pride of Jerusalem.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly
follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and
worship them, shall be like this waistcloth, which is good for nothing.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For as the waistcloth clings to the loins of a man, so I made the
whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, says
the LORD, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a
glory, but they would not listen.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` "You shall speak to them this word: `Thus says the LORD, the God of
Israel, "Every jar shall be filled with wine."' And they will say to
you, `Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?'

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then you shall say to them, `Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will

'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Give glory to the LORD your God before he brings darkness, before
your feet stumble on the twilight mountains, and while you look for
light he turns it into gloom and makes it deep darkness.

"17" = ''':sup:`17` But if you will not listen, my soul will weep in secret for your
pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears, because the

the flock that was given you, your beautiful flock?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` What will you say when they set as head over you those whom you
yourself have taught to be friends to you? Will not pangs take hold of
you, like those of a woman in travail?
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And if you say in your heart, `Why have these things come upon me?'
it is for the greatness of your iniquity that your skirts are lifted
up, and you suffer violence.

'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` I will scatter you like chaff driven by the wind from the desert.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` This is your lot, the portion I have measured out to you, says the

lewd harlotries, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, O Jerusalem!
How long will it be before you are made clean?"

Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-11 - The parable of the filthy belt is used to illustrate the
corruption of the people of Judah. God compares Israel to a belt,
which, when used incorrectly, becomes useless. Disobedience to the Lord
13:12-14 - The prophecy that the wine jars will be broken symbolizes
Judah's impending destruction. The people's pride and confidence in
13:15-17 - The call to repentance is made to avoid destruction. God
warns the people not to harden their hearts, for divine judgment is
approaching, and repentance is the only way to avoid calamity (see also
13:18-23 - The humiliation of Judah and the judgment upon the nation
are foretold, for the people have turned away from God. The analogy of
the woman and the girdle illustrates the nearness of the judgment that
will be visited upon Judah (see also 2 Kings 24:10-16 and Lamentations
1:18).
13:24-27 - The people will be scattered among the nations, and their
idolatries will be punished. God speaks against the people's pride,
announcing their dispersion and punishment for their sin, but with the
7:34).
