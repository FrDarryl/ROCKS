"1" = ''':sup:`1` In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite
was sojourning in the remote parts of the hill country of E'phraim, who
took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And his concubine became angry with him, and she went away from him
to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four
months.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her
and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of asses.
And he came to her father's house; and when the girl's father saw him,
he came with joy to meet him.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And his father-in-law, the girl's father, made him stay, and he
remained with him three days; so they ate and drank, and lodged there.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he
prepared to go; but the girl's father said to his son-in-law,
"Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may
go."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So the two men sat and ate and drank together; and the girl's father
said to the man, "Be pleased to spend the night, and let your heart be
merry."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And when the man rose up to go, his father-in-law urged him, till he
lodged there again.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart; and
the girl's father said, "Strengthen your heart, and tarry until the day
declines." So they ate, both of them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to
depart, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Behold, now
the day has waned toward evening; pray tarry all night. Behold, the day
draws to its close; lodge here and let your heart be merry; and
tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey, and go
home."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But the man would not spend the night; he rose up and departed, and
arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple
of saddled asses, and his concubine was with him.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` When they were near Jebus, the day was far spent, and the servant
said to his master, "Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the
Jeb'usites, and spend the night in it."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And his master said to him, "We will not turn aside into the city
of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel; but we will
pass on to Gib'e-ah."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And he said to his servant, "Come and let us draw near to one of
these places, and spend the night at Gib'e-ah or at Ramah."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them
near Gib'e-ah, which belongs to Benjamin,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at
Gib'e-ah. And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city;
for no man took them into his house to spend the night.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at
evening; the man was from the hill country of E'phraim, and he was
sojourning in Gib'e-ah; the men of the place were Benjaminites.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfarer in the open square
of the city; and the old man said, "Where are you going? and whence do
you come?"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he said to him, "We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the
remote parts of the hill country of E'phraim, from which I come. I went
to Bethlehem in Judah; and I am going to my home; and nobody takes me
into his house.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` We have straw and provender for our asses, with bread and wine for
me and your maidservant and the young man with your servants; there is
no lack of anything."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And the old man said, "Peace be to you; I will care for all your
wants; only, do not spend the night in the square."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So he brought him into his house, and gave the asses provender; and
they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the
city, base fellows, beset the house round about, beating on the door;
and they said to the old man, the master of the house, "Bring out the
man who came into your house, that we may know him."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to
them, "No, my brethren, do not act so wickedly; seeing that this man
has come into my house, do not do this vile thing.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine; let me bring
them out now. Ravish them and do with them what seems good to you; but
against this man do not do so vile a thing."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his
concubine, and put her out to them; and they knew her, and abused her
all night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let
her go.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door
of the man's house where her master was, till it was light.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And her master rose up in the morning, and when he opened the doors
of the house and went out to go on his way, behold, there was his
concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the
threshold.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` He said to her, "Get up, let us be going." But there was no answer.
Then he put her upon the ass; and the man rose up and went away to his
home.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And when he entered his house, he took a knife, and laying hold of
his concubine he divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and
sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And all who saw it said, "Such a thing has never happened or been
seen from the day that the people of Israel came up out of the land of
Egypt until this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak."
