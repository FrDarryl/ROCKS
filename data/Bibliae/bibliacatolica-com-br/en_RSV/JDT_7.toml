"1" = ''':sup:`1` The next day Holofernes ordered his whole army, and all the allies
who had joined him, to break camp and move against Bethulia, and to
seize the passes up into the hill country and make war on the
Israelites.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So all their warriors moved their camp that day; their force of men
of war was one hundred and seventy thousand infantry and twelve
thousand cavalry, together with the baggage and the foot soldiers
handling it, a very great multitude.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` They encamped in the valley near Bethulia, beside the spring, and
they spread out in breadth over Dothan as far as Balbaim and in length
from Bethulia to Cyamon, which faces Esdraelon.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When the Israelites saw their vast numbers they were greatly
terrified, and every one said to his neighbor, "These men will now lick
up the face of the whole land; neither the high mountains nor the
valleys nor the hills will bear their weight."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then each man took up his weapons, and when they had kindled fires
on their towers they remained on guard all that night.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` On the second day Holofernes led out all his cavalry in full view of
the Israelites in Bethulia,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and examined the approaches to the city, and visited the springs
that supplied their water, and seized them and set guards of soldiers
over them, and then returned to his army.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then all the chieftains of the people of Esau and all the leaders of
the Moabites and the commanders of the coastland came to him and said,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "Let our lord hear a word, lest his army be defeated.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For these people, the Israelites, do not rely on their spears but
on the height of the mountains where they live, for it is not easy to
reach the tops of their mountains.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Therefore, my lord, do not fight against them in battle array, and
not a man of your army will fall.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Remain in your camp, and keep all the men in your forces with you;
only let your servants take possession of the spring of water that
flows from the foot of the mountain --
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` for this is where all the people of Bethulia get their water. So
thirst will destroy them, and they will give up their city. We and our
people will go up to the tops of the nearby mountains and camp there to
keep watch that not a man gets out of the city.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` They and their wives and children will waste away with famine, and
before the sword reaches them they will be strewn about in the streets
where they live.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So you will pay them back with evil, because they rebelled and did
not receive you peaceably."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` These words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, and he gave
orders to do as they had said.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So the army of the Ammonites moved forward, together with five
thousand Assyrians, and they encamped in the valley and seized the
water supply and the springs of the Israelites.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the sons of Esau and the sons of Ammon went up and encamped in
the hill country opposite Dothan; and they sent some of their men
toward the south and the east, toward Acraba, which is near Chusi
beside the brook Mochmur. The rest of the Assyrian army encamped in the
plain, and covered the whole face of the land, and their tents and
supply trains spread out in great number, and they formed a vast
multitude.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` The people of Israel cried out to the Lord their God, for their
courage failed, because all their enemies had surrounded them and there
was no way of escape from them.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The whole Assyrian army, their infantry, chariots, and cavalry,
surrounded them for thirty-four days, until all the vessels of water
belonging to every inhabitant of Bethulia were empty;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` their cisterns were going dry, and they did not have enough water
to drink their fill for a single day, because it was measured out to
them to drink.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Their children lost heart, and the women and young men fainted from
thirst and fell down in the streets of the city and in the passages
through the gates; there was no strength left in them any longer.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then all the people, the young men, the women, and the children,
gathered about Uzziah and the rulers of the city and cried out with a
loud voice, and said before all the elders,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` "God be judge between you and us! For you have done us a great
injury in not making peace with the Assyrians.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` For now we have no one to help us; God has sold us into their
hands, to strew us on the ground before them with thirst and utter
destruction.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Now call them in and surrender the whole city to the army of
Holofernes and to all his forces, to be plundered.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` For it would be better for us to be captured by them; for we will
be slaves, but our lives will be spared, and we shall not witness the
death of our babes before our eyes, or see our wives and children draw
their last breath.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` We call to witness against you heaven and earth and our God, the
Lord of our fathers, who punishes us according to our sins and the sins
of our fathers. Let him not do this day the things which we have
described!"
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then great and general lamentation arose throughout the assembly,
and they cried out to the Lord God with a loud voice.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Uzziah said to them, "Have courage, my brothers! Let us hold
out for five more days; by that time the Lord our God will restore to
us his mercy, for he will not forsake us utterly.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But if these days pass by, and no help comes for us, I will do what
you say."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then he dismissed the people to their various posts, and they went
up on the walls and towers of their city. The women and children he
sent home. And they were greatly depressed in the city.
