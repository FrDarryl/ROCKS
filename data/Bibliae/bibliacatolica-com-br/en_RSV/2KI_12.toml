"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Jeho'ash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all his
days, because Jehoi'ada the priest instructed him.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; the people

'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Jeho'ash said to the priests, "All the money of the holy things
which is brought into the house of the LORD, the money for which each
man is assessed -- the money from the assessment of persons -- and the
money which a man's heart prompts him to bring into the house of the
LORD,

"5" = ''':sup:`5` let the priests take, each from his acquaintance; and let them
repair the house wherever any need of repairs is discovered."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But by the twenty-third year of King Jeho'ash the priests had made
no repairs on the house.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Therefore King Jeho'ash summoned Jehoi'ada the priest and the other
priests and said to them, "Why are you not repairing the house? Now
therefore take no more money from your acquaintances, but hand it over
for the repair of the house."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So the priests agreed that they should take no more money from the
people, and that they should not repair the house.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then Jehoi'ada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid
of it, and set it beside the altar on the right side as one entered the
house of the LORD; and the priests who guarded the threshold put in it
all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And whenever they saw that there was much money in the chest, the
king's secretary and the high priest came up and they counted and tied
up in bags the money that was found in the house of the LORD.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then they would give the money that was weighed out into the hands
of the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and they
paid it out to the carpenters and the builders who worked upon the
house of the LORD,
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and to the masons and the stonecutters, as well as to buy timber
and quarried stone for making repairs on the house of the LORD, and for
any outlay upon the repairs of the house.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But there were not made for the house of the LORD basins of silver,
snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any vessels of gold, or of silver, from
the money that was brought into the house of the LORD,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` for that was given to the workmen who were repairing the house of
the LORD with it.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And they did not ask an accounting from the men into whose hand
they delivered the money to pay out to the workmen, for they dealt
honestly.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin
offerings was not brought into the house of the LORD; it belonged to
the priests.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` At that time Haz'ael king of Syria went up and fought against Gath,
and took it. But when Haz'ael set his face to go up against Jerusalem,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Jeho'ash king of Judah took all the votive gifts that Jehosh'aphat
and Jeho'ram and Ahazi'ah, his fathers, the kings of Judah, had
dedicated, and his own votive gifts, and all the gold that was found in
the treasuries of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and
sent these to Haz'ael king of Syria. Then Haz'ael went away from
Jerusalem.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Now the rest of the acts of Jo'ash, and all that he did, are they
not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

"20" = ''':sup:`20` His servants arose and made a conspiracy, and slew Jo'ash in the
house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` It was Jo'zacar the son of Shim'e-ath and Jeho'zabad the son of
Shomer, his servants, who struck him down, so that he died. And they
buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amazi'ah his son
reigned in his stead.
