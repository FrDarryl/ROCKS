"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great
multitude of cattle; and they saw the land of Jazer and the land of
Gilead, and behold, the place was a place for cattle.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` So the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and said to Moses and
to Elea'zar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` "At'aroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elea'leh, Sebam, Nebo, and
Be'on,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` the land which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is
a land for cattle; and your servants have cattle."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And they said, "If we have found favor in your sight, let this land
be given to your servants for a possession; do not take us across the
Jordan."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, "Shall
your brethren go to the war while you sit here?
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Why will you discourage the heart of the people of Israel from going
over into the land which the LORD has given them?
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Ka'desh-bar'nea to see
the land.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
they discouraged the heart of the people of Israel from going into the
land which the LORD had given them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the LORD's anger was kindled on that day, and he swore, saying,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` `Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years
old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not wholly followed me;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` none except Caleb the son of Jephun'neh the Ken'izzite and Joshua
the son of Nun, for they have wholly followed the LORD.'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them
wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had
done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And behold, you have risen in your fathers' stead, a brood of
sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the LORD against
Israel!
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For if you turn away from following him, he will again abandon them
in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then they came near to him, and said, "We will build sheepfolds
here for our flocks, and cities for our little ones,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` but we will take up arms, ready to go before the people of Israel,
until we have brought them to their place; and our little ones shall
live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` We will not return to our homes until the people of Israel have
inherited each his inheritance.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan
and beyond; because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the
Jordan to the east."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So Moses said to them, "If you will do this, if you will take up
arms to go before the LORD for the war,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the
LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and the land is subdued before the LORD; then after that you shall
return and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel; and this
land shall be your possession before the LORD.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the
LORD; and be sure your sin will find you out.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do
what you have promised."
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben said to Moses, "Your
servants will do as my lord commands.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall
remain there in the cities of Gilead;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war,
before the LORD to battle, as my lord orders."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So Moses gave command concerning them to Elea'zar the priest, and
to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' houses of
the tribes of the people of Israel.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And Moses said to them, "If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben,
every man who is armed to battle before the LORD, will pass with you
over the Jordan and the land shall be subdued before you, then you
shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession;
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
possessions among you in the land of Canaan."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, "As the LORD
has said to your servants, so we will do.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,
and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the
Jordan."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of
Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manas'seh the son of Joseph, the
kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of
Bashan, the land and its cities with their territories, the cities of
the land throughout the country.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And the sons of Gad built Dibon, At'aroth, Aro'er,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` At'roth-sho'phan, Jazer, Jog'behah,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Beth-nim'rah and Beth-har'an, fortified cities, and folds for
sheep.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elea'leh, Kiriatha'im,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Nebo, and Ba'al-me'on (their names to be changed), and Sibmah; and
they gave other names to the cities which they built.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And the sons of Machir the son of Manas'seh went to Gilead and took
it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manas'seh, and he
settled in it.

"41" = ''':sup:`41` And Ja'ir the son of Manas'seh went and took their villages, and
called them Hav'voth-ja'ir.
