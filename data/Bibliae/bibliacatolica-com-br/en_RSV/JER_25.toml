the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` "For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josi'ah the son
of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the LORD has come to
me, and I have spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me
to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.'

"7" = ''':sup:`7` Yet you have not listened to me, says the LORD, that you might
provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` "Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Because you have not obeyed
my words,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, says the LORD,
and for Nebuchadrez'zar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will
bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these
nations round about; I will utterly destroy them, and make them a
horror, a hissing, and an everlasting reproach.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice

"11" = ''':sup:`11` This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations
shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of
Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chalde'ans, for their
iniquity, says the LORD, making the land an everlasting waste.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` I will bring upon that land all the words which I have uttered

earth.

"31" = ''':sup:`31` The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth, for the LORD has
an indictment against the nations; he is entering into judgment with
all flesh, and the wicked he will put to the sword, says the LORD.'
