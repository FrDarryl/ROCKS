3:1-5 - The peace offering was a sacrifice of communion, celebrating
peace between God and man. The blood, which represented life, was to be
3:6-11 - As with the burnt offering, the animal offered had to be
without defect. This emphasizes the need for purity and integrity in
3:12-16 - The fat of the animal, considered the best part, was to be
offered to the Lord. This reflects the principle that the best of our
03:17 - God forbids the consumption of fat and blood, indicating the
sanctity of these elements in the sacrificial context. Blood is life,
and life belongs to God and is consecrated to Him (see also
03:16 - The fire on the altar burns continually, consuming the fat of
the peace offering, representing the perpetual commitment to worship
8:3-4).
