kept, and ordered them to set a table for her with some of his own food
and to serve her with his own wine.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` But Judith said, "I cannot eat it, lest it be an offense; but I will
be provided from the things I have brought with me."

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Holofernes said to her, "If your supply runs out, where can we get
more like it for you? For none of your people is here with us."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Judith replied, "As your soul lives, my lord, your servant will not
use up the things I have with me before the Lord carries out by my hand
what he has determined to do."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then the servants of Holofernes brought her into the tent, and she
slept until midnight. Along toward the morning watch she arose

"6" = ''':sup:`6` and sent to Holofernes and said, "Let my lord now command that your
servant be permitted to go out and pray."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So Holofernes commanded his guards not to hinder her. And she
remained in the camp for three days, and went out each night to the
valley of Bethulia, and bathed at the spring in the camp.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When she came up from the spring she prayed the Lord God of Israel
to direct her way for the raising up of her people.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So she returned clean and stayed in the tent until she ate her food
toward evening.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` On the fourth day Holofernes held a banquet for his slave only, and
did not invite any of his officers.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And he said to Bagoas, the eunuch who had charge of his personal
affairs, "Go now and persuade the Hebrew woman who is in your care to
join us and eat and drink with us.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For it will be a disgrace if we let such a woman go without
enjoying her company, for if we do not embrace her she will laugh at
us."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Bagoas went out from the presence of Holofernes, and approached
her and said, "This beautiful maidservant will please come to my lord
and be honored in his presence, and drink wine and be merry with us,
and become today like one of the daughters of the Assyrians who serve
in the house of Nebuchadnezzar."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And Judith said, "Who am I, to refuse my lord? Surely whatever
pleases him I will do at once, and it will be a joy to me until the day
of my death!"
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So she got up and arrayed herself in all her woman's finery, and
her maid went and spread on the ground for her before Holofernes the
soft fleeces which she had received from Bagoas for her daily use, so
that she might recline on them when she ate.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then Judith came in and lay down, and Holofernes' heart was
ravished with her and he was moved with great desire to possess her;
for he had been waiting for an opportunity to deceive her, ever since
the day he first saw her.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So Holofernes said to her. "Drink now, and be merry with us!"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Judith said, "I will drink now, my lord, because my life means more
to me today than in all the days since I was born."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid had
prepared.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Holofernes was greatly pleased with her, and drank a great
quantity of wine, much more than he had ever drunk in any one day since
he was born.
