"1" = ''':sup:`1` Simon heard that Trypho had assembled a large army to invade the
land of Judah and destroy it,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` and he saw that the people were trembling and fearful. So he went up
to Jerusalem, and gathering the people together
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` he encouraged them, saying to them, "You yourselves know what great
things I and my brothers and the house of my father have done for the
laws and the sanctuary; you know also the wars and the difficulties
which we have seen.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` By reason of this all my brothers have perished for the sake of
Israel, and I alone am left.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And now, far be it from me to spare my life in any time of distress,
for I am not better than my brothers.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But I will avenge my nation and the sanctuary and your wives and
children, for all the nations have gathered together out of hatred to
destroy us."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The spirit of the people was rekindled when they heard these words,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` and they answered in a loud voice, "You are our leader in place of
Judas and Jonathan your brother.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Fight our battles, and all that you say to us we will do."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So he assembled all the warriors and hastened to complete the walls
of Jerusalem, and he fortified it on every side.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He sent Jonathan the son of Absalom to Joppa, and with him a
considerable army; he drove out its occupants and remained there.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then Trypho departed from Ptolemais with a large army to invade the
land of Judah, and Jonathan was with him under guard.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And Simon encamped in Adida, facing the plain.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Trypho learned that Simon had risen up in place of Jonathan his
brother, and that he was about to join battle with him, so he sent
envoys to him and said,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` "It is for the money that Jonathan your brother owed the royal
treasury, in connection with the offices he held, that we are detaining
him.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Send now a hundred talents of silver and two of his sons as
hostages, so that when released he will not revolt against us, and we
will release him."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Simon knew that they were speaking deceitfully to him, but he sent
to get the money and the sons, lest he arouse great hostility among the
people, who might say,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Because Simon did not send him the money and the sons, he
perished."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So he sent the sons and the hundred talents, but Trypho broke his
word and did not release Jonathan.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` After this Trypho came to invade the country and destroy it, and he
circled around by the way to Adora. But Simon and his army kept
marching along opposite him to every place he went.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Now the men in the citadel kept sending envoys to Trypho urging him
to come to them by way of the wilderness and to send them food.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` So Trypho got all his cavalry ready to go, but that night a very
heavy snow fell, and he did not go because of the snow. He marched off
and went into the land of Gilead.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When he approached Baskama, he killed Jonathan, and he was buried
there.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then Trypho turned back and departed to his own land.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And Simon sent and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and
buried him in Modein, the city of his fathers.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` All Israel bewailed him with great lamentation, and mourned for him
many days.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Simon built a monument over the tomb of his father and his
brothers; he made it high that it might be seen, with polished stone at
the front and back.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` He also erected seven pyramids, opposite one another, for his
father and mother and four brothers.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And for the pyramids he devised an elaborate setting, erecting
about them great columns, and upon the columns he put suits of armor
for a permanent memorial, and beside the suits of armor carved ships,
so that they could be seen by all who sail the sea.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` This is the tomb which he built in Modein; it remains to this day.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Trypho dealt treacherously with the young king Antiochus; he killed
him
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and became king in his place, putting on the crown of Asia; and he
brought great calamity upon the land.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` But Simon built up the strongholds of Judea and walled them all
around, with high towers and great walls and gates and bolts, and he
stored food in the strongholds.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Simon also chose men and sent them to Demetrius the king with a
request to grant relief to the country, for all that Trypho did was to
plunder.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Demetrius the king sent him a favorable reply to this request, and
wrote him a letter as follows,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` "King Demetrius to Simon, the high priest and friend of kings, and
to the elders and nation of the Jews, greeting.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` We have received the gold crown and the palm branch which you sent,
and we are ready to make a general peace with you and to write to our
officials to grant you release from tribute.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` All the grants that we have made to you remain valid, and let the
strongholds that you have built be your possession.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` We pardon any errors and offenses committed to this day, and cancel
the crown tax which you owe; and whatever other tax has been collected
in Jerusalem shall be collected no longer.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And if any of you are qualified to be enrolled in our bodyguard,
let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` In the one hundred and seventieth year the yoke of the Gentiles was
removed from Israel,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and the people began to write in their documents and contracts, "In
the first year of Simon the great high priest and commander and leader
of the Jews."
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` In those days Simon encamped against Gazara and surrounded it with
troops. He made a siege engine, brought it up to the city, and battered
and captured one tower.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` The men in the siege engine leaped out into the city, and a great
tumult arose in the city.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` The men in the city, with their wives and children, went up on the
wall with their clothes rent, and they cried out with a loud voice,
asking Simon to make peace with them;
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` they said, "Do not treat us according to our wicked acts but
according to your mercy."
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` So Simon reached an agreement with them and stopped fighting
against them. But he expelled them from the city and cleansed the
houses in which the idols were, and then entered it with hymns and
praise.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` He cast out of it all uncleanness, and settled in it men who
observed the law. He also strengthened its fortifications and built in
it a house for himself.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` The men in the citadel at Jerusalem were prevented from going out
to the country and back to buy and sell. So they were very hungry, and
many of them perished from famine.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Then they cried to Simon to make peace with them, and he did so.
But he expelled them from there and cleansed the citadel from its
pollutions.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` On the twenty-third day of the second month, in the one hundred and
seventy-first year, the Jews entered it with praise and palm branches,
and with harps and cymbals and stringed instruments, and with hymns and
songs, because a great enemy had been crushed and removed from Israel.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` And Simon decreed that every year they should celebrate this day
with rejoicing. He strengthened the fortifications of the temple hill
alongside the citadel, and he and his men dwelt there.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` And Simon saw that John his son had reached manhood, so he made him
commander of all the forces, and he dwelt in Gazara.
