"1" = ''':sup:`1` Antiochus, the son of Demetrius the king, sent a letter from the
islands of the sea to Simon, the priest and ethnarch of the Jews, and
to all the nation;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` its contents were as follows: "King Antiochus to Simon the high
priest and ethnarch and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Whereas certain pestilent men have gained control of the kingdom of
our fathers, and I intend to lay claim to the kingdom so that I may
restore it as it formerly was, and have recruited a host of mercenary
troops and have equipped warships,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and intend to make a landing in the country so that I may proceed
against those who have destroyed our country and those who have
devastated many cities in my kingdom,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` now therefore I confirm to you all the tax remissions that the kings
before me have granted you, and release from all the other payments
from which they have released you.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I permit you to mint your own coinage as money for your country,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` and I grant freedom to Jerusalem and the sanctuary. All the weapons
which you have prepared and the strongholds which you have built and
now hold shall remain yours.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Every debt you owe to the royal treasury and any such future debts
shall be canceled for you from henceforth and for all time.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When we gain control of our kingdom, we will bestow great honor upon
you and your nation and the temple, so that your glory will become
manifest in all the earth."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` In the one hundred and seventy-fourth year Antiochus set out and
invaded the land of his fathers. All the troops rallied to him, so that
there were few with Trypho.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Antiochus pursued him, and he came in his flight to Dor, which is
by the sea;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` for he knew that troubles had converged upon him, and his troops
had deserted him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` So Antiochus encamped against Dor, and with him were a hundred and
twenty thousand warriors and eight thousand cavalry.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He surrounded the city, and the ships joined battle from the sea;
he pressed the city hard from land and sea, and permitted no one to
leave or enter it.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then Numenius and his companions arrived from Rome, with letters to
the kings and countries, in which the following was written:
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Lucius, consul of the Romans, to King Ptolemy, greeting.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The envoys of the Jews have come to us as our friends and allies to
renew our ancient friendship and alliance. They had been sent by Simon
the high priest and by the people of the Jews,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` and have brought a gold shield weighing a thousand minas.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` We therefore have decided to write to the kings and countries that
they should not seek their harm or make war against them and their
cities and their country, or make alliance with those who war against
them.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And it has seemed good to us to accept the shield from them.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Therefore if any pestilent men have fled to you from their country,
hand them over to Simon the high priest, that he may punish them
according to their law."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` The consul wrote the same thing to Demetrius the king and to
Attalus and Ariarathes and Arsaces,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and to all the countries, and to Sampsames, and to the Spartans,
and to Delos, and to Myndos, and to Sicyon, and to Caria, and to Samos,
and to Pamphylia, and to Lycia, and to Halicarnassus, and to Rhodes,
and to Phaselis, and to Cos, and to Side, and to Aradus and Gortyna and
Cnidus and Cyprus and Cyrene.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` They also sent a copy of these things to Simon the high priest.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Antiochus the king besieged Dor anew, continually throwing his
forces against it and making engines of war; and he shut Trypho up and
kept him from going out or in.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And Simon sent to Antiochus two thousand picked men, to fight for
him, and silver and gold and much military equipment.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But he refused to receive them, and he broke all the agreements he
formerly had made with Simon, and became estranged from him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` He sent to him Athenobius, one of his friends, to confer with him,
saying, "You hold control of Joppa and Gazara and the citadel in
Jerusalem; they are cities of my kingdom.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` You have devastated their territory, you have done great damage in
the land, and you have taken possession of many places in my kingdom.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Now then, hand over the cities which you have seized and the
tribute money of the places which you have conquered outside the
borders of Judea;
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver, and for
the destruction that you have caused and the tribute money of the
cities, five hundred talents more. Otherwise we will come and conquer
you."
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So Athenobius the friend of the king came to Jerusalem, and when he
saw the splendor of Simon, and the sideboard with its gold and silver
plate, and his great magnificence, he was amazed. He reported to him
the words of the king,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` but Simon gave him this reply: "We have neither taken foreign land
nor seized foreign property, but only the inheritance of our fathers,
which at one time had been unjustly taken by our enemies.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Now that we have the opportunity, we are firmly holding the
inheritance of our fathers.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` As for Joppa and Gazara, which you demand, they were causing great
damage among the people and to our land; for them we will give you a
hundred talents." Athenobius did not answer him a word,
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` but returned in wrath to the king and reported to him these words
and the splendor of Simon and all that he had seen. And the king was
greatly angered.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Now Trypho embarked on a ship and escaped to Orthosia.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Then the king made Cendebeus commander-in-chief of the coastal
country, and gave him troops of infantry and cavalry.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` He commanded him to encamp against Judea, and commanded him to
build up Kedron and fortify its gates, and to make war on the people;
but the king pursued Trypho.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` So Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the people and
invade Judea and take the people captive and kill them.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` He built up Kedron and stationed there horsemen and troops, so that
they might go out and make raids along the highways of Judea, as the
king had ordered him.
