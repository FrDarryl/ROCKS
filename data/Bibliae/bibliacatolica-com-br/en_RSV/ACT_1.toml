"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the first book, O The-oph'ilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus
began to do and teach,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commandment
through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` To them he presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs,
appearing to them during forty days, and speaking of the kingdom of
God.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And while staying with them he charged them not to depart from
Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said,
"you heard from me,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` for John baptized with water, but before many days you shall be
baptized with the Holy Spirit."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at
this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which
the Father has fixed by his own authority.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you;
and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
Sama'ria and to the end of the earth."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted
up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men
stood by them in white robes,
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven?
This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the
same way as you saw him go into heaven."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which
is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey away;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where
they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and
Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon
the Zealot and Judas the son of James.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together
with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` In those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of
persons was in all about a hundred and twenty), and said,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "Brethren, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit
spoke beforehand by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide
to those who arrested Jesus.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For he was numbered among us, and was allotted his share in this
ministry.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` (Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness; and
falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed
out.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that
the field was called in their language Akel'dama, that is, Field of
Blood.)
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For it is written in the book of Psalms, `Let his habitation become
desolate, and let there be no one to live in it'; and `His office let
another take.'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that
the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken
up from us -- one of these men must become with us a witness to his
resurrection."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsab'bas, who was
surnamed Justus, and Matthi'as.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And they prayed and said, "Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men,
show which one of these two thou hast chosen
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas
turned aside, to go to his own place."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthi'as; and he
was enrolled with the eleven apostles.
