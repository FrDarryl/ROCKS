spies, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." And they went,
and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged
there.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` And it was told the king of Jericho, "Behold, certain men of Israel
have come here tonight to search out the land."

that have come to you, who entered your house; for they have come to
search out all the land."

"4" = ''':sup:`4` But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them; and she said,
"True, men came to me, but I did not know where they came from;

"5" = ''':sup:`5` and when the gate was to be closed, at dark, the men went out; where
the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you will overtake
them."

"6" = ''':sup:`6` But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the
stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the
fords; and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` and said to the men, "I know that the LORD has given you the land,

inhabitants of the land melt away before you.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea
before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two
kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og,
whom you utterly destroyed.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no
courage left in any man, because of you; for the LORD your God is he
who is God in heaven above and on earth beneath.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now then, swear to me by the LORD that as I have dealt kindly with
you, you also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a
sure sign,

"13" = ''':sup:`13` and save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and
all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the men said to her, "Our life for yours! If you do not tell
this business of ours, then we will deal kindly and faithfully with you
when the LORD gives us the land."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house
was built into the city wall, so that she dwelt in the wall.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And she said to them, "Go into the hills, lest the pursuers meet
you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have
returned; then afterward you may go your way."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The men said to her, "We will be guiltless with respect to this
oath of yours which you have made us swear.

cord in the window through which you let us down; and you shall gather
into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your
father's household.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` If any one goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his
blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless; but if a hand
is laid upon any one who is with you in the house, his blood shall be
on our head.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless
with respect to your oath which you have made us swear."

"21" = ''':sup:`21` And she said, "According to your words, so be it." Then she sent
them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet cord in the
window.

"22" = ''':sup:`22` They departed, and went into the hills, and remained there three
days, until the pursuers returned; for the pursuers had made search all
along the way and found nothing.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then the two men came down again from the hills, and passed over
and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had
befallen them.
