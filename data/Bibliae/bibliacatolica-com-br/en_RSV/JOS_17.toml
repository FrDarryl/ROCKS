the leaders, and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an
inheritance along with our brethren." So according to the commandment
of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their
father.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Thus there fell to Manas'seh ten portions, besides the land of
Gilead and Bashan, which is on the other side of the Jordan;

"6" = ''':sup:`6` because the daughters of Manas'seh received an inheritance along
with his sons. The land of Gilead was allotted to the rest of the
Manas'sites.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` The territory of Manas'seh reached from Asher to Mich-me'thath,
which is east of Shechem; then the boundary goes along southward to the
inhabitants of En-tap'puah.

on the boundary of Manas'seh belonged to the sons of E'phraim.

the south of the brook, among the cities of Manas'seh, belong to
E'phraim. Then the boundary of Manas'seh goes on the north side of the
brook and ends at the sea;

inhabitants of Ta'anach and its villages, and the inhabitants of
Megid'do and its villages; the third is Naphath.

cities; but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` But when the people of Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites
to forced labor, and did not utterly drive them out.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the tribe of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, "Why have you
given me but one lot and one portion as an inheritance, although I am a
numerous people, since hitherto the LORD has blessed me?"
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And Joshua said to them, "If you are a numerous people, go up to
the forest, and there clear ground for yourselves in the land of the
Per'izzites and the Reph'aim, since the hill country of E'phraim is too
narrow for you."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The tribe of Joseph said, "The hill country is not enough for us;
yet all the Canaanites who dwell in the plain have chariots of iron,
both those in Beth-she'an and its villages and those in the Valley of
Jezreel."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to E'phraim and Manas'seh,
"You are a numerous people, and have great power; you shall not have
one lot only,

"18" = ''':sup:`18` but the hill country shall be yours, for though it is a forest, you
shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders; for you shall
drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though
they are strong."
