"1" = ''':sup:`1` "Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my
pasture!" says the LORD.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the
shepherds who care for my people: "You have scattered my flock, and
have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I
will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries
where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and
they shall be fruitful and multiply.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they
shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, says
the LORD.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` "Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will raise up
for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal
wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And
this is the name by which he will be called: `The LORD is our
righteousness.'
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` "Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when men
shall no longer say, `As the LORD lives who brought up the people of
Israel out of the land of Egypt,'
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` but `As the LORD lives who brought up and led the descendants of the
house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries
where he had driven them.' Then they shall dwell in their own land."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me, all my bones
shake; I am like a drunken man, like a man overcome by wine, because of
the LORD and because of his holy words.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For the land is full of adulterers; because of the curse the land
mourns, and the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. Their course
is evil, and their might is not right.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "Both prophet and priest are ungodly; even in my house I have found
their wickedness, says the LORD.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Therefore their way shall be to them like slippery paths in the
darkness, into which they shall be driven and fall; for I will bring
evil upon them in the year of their punishment, says the LORD.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` In the prophets of Sama'ria I saw an unsavory thing: they
prophesied by Ba'al and led my people Israel astray.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: they
commit adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen the hands of
evildoers, so that no one turns from his wickedness; all of them have
become like Sodom to me, and its inhabitants like Gomor'rah."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets:
"Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and give them poisoned water
to drink; for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone forth
into all the land."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Do not listen to the words of the
prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes; they speak
visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, `It
shall be well with you'; and to every one who stubbornly follows his
own heart, they say, `No evil shall come upon you.'"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For who among them has stood in the council of the LORD to perceive
and to hear his word, or who has given heed to his word and listened?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Behold, the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling
tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and
accomplished the intents of his mind. In the latter days you will
understand it clearly.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to
them, yet they prophesied.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But if they had stood in my council, then they would have
proclaimed my words to my people, and they would have turned them from
their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` "Am I a God at hand, says the LORD, and not a God afar off?
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him?
says the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? says the LORD.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my
name, saying, `I have dreamed, I have dreamed!'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who
prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams which
they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Ba'al?
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has
my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat?
says the LORD.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Is not my word like fire, says the LORD, and like a hammer which
breaks the rock in pieces?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, who
steal my words from one another.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Behold, I am against the prophets, says the LORD, who use their
tongues and say, `Says the LORD.'
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says the
LORD, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and
their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them; so they do
not profit this people at all, says the LORD.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` "When one of this people, or a prophet, or a priest asks you, `What
is the burden of the LORD?' you shall say to them, `You are the burden,
and I will cast you off, says the LORD.'
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, `The
burden of the LORD,' I will punish that man and his household.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his
brother, `What has the LORD answered?' or `What has the LORD spoken?'
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` But `the burden of the LORD' you shall mention no more, for the
burden is every man's own word, and you pervert the words of the living
God, the LORD of hosts, our God.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Thus you shall say to the prophet, `What has the LORD answered
you?' or `What has the LORD spoken?'
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` But if you say, `The burden of the LORD,' thus says the LORD,
`Because you have said these words, "The burden of the LORD," when I
sent to you, saying, "You shall not say, `The burden of the LORD,'"
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from
my presence, you and the city which I gave to you and your fathers.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame,
which shall not be forgotten.'"
