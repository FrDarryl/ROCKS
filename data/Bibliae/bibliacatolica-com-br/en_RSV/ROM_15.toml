instruction, that by steadfastness and by the encouragement of the
scriptures we might have hope.

such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,

our Lord Jesus Christ.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Welcome one another, therefore, as Christ has welcomed you, for the
glory of God.

show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the
patriarchs,

it is written, "Therefore I will praise thee among the Gentiles, and
sing to thy name";

"14" = ''':sup:`14` I myself am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves
are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct
one another.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of
reminder, because of the grace given me by God
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly
service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may
be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for
God.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has
wrought through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and
deed,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit,
so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyr'icum I have fully
preached the gospel of Christ,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` thus making it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ
has already been named, lest I build on another man's foundation,

"21" = ''':sup:`21` but as it is written, "They shall see who have never been told of
him, and they shall understand who have never heard of him."

"24" = ''':sup:`24` I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain, and to be sped on my
journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a little.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem with aid for the
saints.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For Macedo'nia and Acha'ia have been pleased to make some
contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` they were pleased to do it, and indeed they are in debt to them,
for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings,
they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` When therefore I have completed this, and have delivered to them
what has been raised, I shall go on by way of you to Spain;
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` and I know that when I come to you I shall come in the fulness of
the blessing of Christ.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` I appeal to you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love
of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my
behalf,

service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,
