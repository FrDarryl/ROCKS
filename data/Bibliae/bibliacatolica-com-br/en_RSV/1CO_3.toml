"1" = ''':sup:`1` But I, brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as men
of the flesh, as babes in Christ.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not ready for it;
and even yet you are not ready,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and
strife among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving like ordinary
men?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For when one says, "I belong to Paul," and another, "I belong to
Apol'los," are you not merely men?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` What then is Apol'los? What is Paul? Servants through whom you
believed, as the Lord assigned to each.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` I planted, Apol'los watered, but God gave the growth.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God
who gives the growth.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` He who plants and he who waters are equal, and each shall receive
his wages according to his labor.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's
building.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master
builder I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let
each man take care how he builds upon it.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For no other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid,
which is Jesus Christ.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now if any one builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious
stones, wood, hay, straw --
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` each man's work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it,
because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort
of work each one has done.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he
will receive a reward.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he
himself will be saved, but only as through fire.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit
dwells in you?
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` If any one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's
temple is holy, and that temple you are.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks that he is
wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written,
"He catches the wise in their craftiness,"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are
futile."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So let no one boast of men. For all things are yours,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` whether Paul or Apol'los or Cephas or the world or life or death or
the present or the future, all are yours;
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
