"1" = ''':sup:`1` And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a marriage
feast for his son,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage
feast; but they would not come.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Again he sent other servants, saying, `Tell those who are invited,
Behold, I have made ready my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves are
killed, and everything is ready; come to the marriage feast.'
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But they made light of it and went off, one to his farm, another to
his business,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and
killed them.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those
murderers and burned their city.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then he said to his servants, `The wedding is ready, but those
invited were not worthy.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Go therefore to the thoroughfares, and invite to the marriage feast
as many as you find.'
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom
they found, both bad and good; so the wedding hall was filled with
guests.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a
man who had no wedding garment;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` and he said to him, `Friend, how did you get in here without a
wedding garment?' And he was speechless.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then the king said to the attendants, `Bind him hand and foot, and
cast him into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their
teeth.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For many are called, but few are chosen."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle him in his
talk.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Hero'di-ans,
saying, "Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God
truthfully, and care for no man; for you do not regard the position of
men.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar,
or not?"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, "Why put me to the test,
you hypocrites?
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Show me the money for the tax." And they brought him a coin.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And Jesus said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` They said, "Caesar's." Then he said to them, "Render therefore to
Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are
God's."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When they heard it, they marveled; and they left him and went away.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` The same day Sad'ducees came to him, who say that there is no
resurrection; and they asked him a question,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` saying, "Teacher, Moses said, `If a man dies, having no children,
his brother must marry the widow, and raise up children for his
brother.'
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Now there were seven brothers among us; the first married, and
died, and having no children left his wife to his brother.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` So too the second and third, down to the seventh.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` After them all, the woman died.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` In the resurrection, therefore, to which of the seven will she be
wife? For they all had her."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` But Jesus answered them, "You are wrong, because you know neither
the scriptures nor the power of God.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in
marriage, but are like angels in heaven.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was
said to you by God,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` `I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sad'ducees,
they came together.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, to test him.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your
heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` This is the great and first commandment.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a
question,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` saying, "What do you think of the Christ? Whose son is he?" They
said to him, "The son of David."
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` He said to them, "How is it then that David, inspired by the
Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` `The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, till I put thy
enemies under thy feet'?
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` If David thus calls him Lord, how is he his son?"
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did any
one dare to ask him any more questions.

Notas de rodap√©:
22:1-14 - The parable of the king's wedding feast illustrates the
rejection of many of God's invitation and the inclusion of others in
the Kingdom, emphasizing the need for proper spiritual clothing (see
22:15-22 - The question about paying taxes to Caesar tests Jesus'
loyalty to Roman authority. His answer, "Render to Caesar the things
that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's," teaches about
22:23-33 - The question of the resurrection raises the doctrine of life
after death. Jesus reveals that in the resurrection, the righteous will
be like angels and that God is the God of the living, affirming the
Corinthians 15:42-44).
22:34-40 - The great commandment is love for God and neighbor. Jesus
summarizes the entire Law and the Prophets in these two commandments,

Messiah, emphasizing that He is David's Lord, pointing to His deity and
