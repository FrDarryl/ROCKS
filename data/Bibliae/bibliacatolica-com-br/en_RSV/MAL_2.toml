glory to my name, says the LORD of hosts, then I will send the curse
upon you and I will curse your blessings; indeed I have already cursed
them, because you do not lay it to heart.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Behold, I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung upon your
faces, the dung of your offerings, and I will put you out of my
presence.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` So shall you know that I have sent this command to you, that my
covenant with Levi may hold, says the LORD of hosts.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` My covenant with him was a covenant of life and peace, and I gave
them to him, that he might fear; and he feared me, he stood in awe of
my name.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his
lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many
from iniquity.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and men should seek
instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of
hosts.

"8" = ''':sup:`8` But you have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in
Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the

weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or
accepts it with favor at your hand.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` You ask, "Why does he not?" Because the LORD was witness to the
covenant between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been
faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Has not the one God made and sustained for us the spirit of life?
And what does he desire? Godly offspring. So take heed to yourselves,

one's garment with violence, says the LORD of hosts. So take heed to
yourselves and do not be faithless."

the God of justice?"
