28:1-10 - The prophecy against the prince of Tyre denounces his
arrogance and his attempt to equal himself with God. The condemnation
of the prince of Tyre highlights how pride and self-sufficiency are
2:4).
28:11-19 - The prophecy against the king of Tyre is one of the most
detailed, describing the fall of a being who was "in Eden, in the
garden of God," a reference to sin and the fall of humanity. The fall
of Tyre is compared to the fall of Lucifer due to pride and rebellion
28:20-23 - God's judgment against Sidon is announced, with the promised
punishment for its wickedness. Sidon's destruction reflects God's
punishment for those who persist in their wicked practices and reject
28:24-26 - Israel's restoration is contrasted with the destruction of
enemy nations. The judgment against Tyre and Sidon is a lesson that
God's vengeance is certain, but it also reveals His faithfulness in
11:25-32).
