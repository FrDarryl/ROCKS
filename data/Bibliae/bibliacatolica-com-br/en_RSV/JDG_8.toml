done to us, not to call us when you went to fight with Mid'ian?" And
they upbraided him violently.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you?
Is not the gleaning of the grapes of E'phraim better than the vintage
of Abi-e'zer?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` God has given into your hands the princes of Mid'ian, Oreb and Zeeb;
what have I been able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger
against him was abated, when he had said this.

hundred men who were with him, faint yet pursuing.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So he said to the men of Succoth, "Pray, give loaves of bread to the
people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah
and Zalmun'na, the kings of Mid'ian."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And the officials of Succoth said, "Are Zebah and Zalmun'na already
in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?"
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Gideon said, "Well then, when the LORD has given Zebah and
Zalmun'na into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the
wilderness and with briers."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And from there he went up to Penu'el, and spoke to them in the same

answered.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And he said to the men of Penu'el, "When I come again in peace, I
will break down this tower."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Now Zebah and Zalmun'na were in Karkor with their army, about
fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the people
of the East; for there had fallen a hundred and twenty thousand men who
drew the sword.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And Gideon went up by the caravan route east of Nobah and
Jog'behah, and attacked the army; for the army was off its guard.

faint?'"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he took the elders of the city and he took thorns of the
wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he broke down the tower of Penu'el, and slew the men of the
city.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then he said to Zebah and Zalmun'na, "Where are the men whom you
slew at Tabor?" They answered, "As you are, so were they, every one of
them; they resembled the sons of a king."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother; as the
LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay you."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And he said to Jether his first-born, "Rise, and slay them." But
the youth did not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was
still a youth.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then Zebah and Zalmun'na said, "Rise yourself, and fall upon us;
for as the man is, so is his strength." And Gideon arose and slew Zebah
and Zalmun'na; and he took the crescents that were on the necks of
their camels.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you and your
son and your grandson also; for you have delivered us out of the hand
of Mid'ian."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Gideon said to them, "I will not rule over you, and my son will not
rule over you; the LORD will rule over you."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Gideon said to them, "Let me make a request of you; give me
every man of you the earrings of his spoil." (For they had golden
earrings, because they were Ish'maelites.)
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And they answered, "We will willingly give them." And they spread a
garment, and every man cast in it the earrings of his spoil.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one
thousand seven hundred shekels of gold; besides the crescents and the
pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Mid'ian, and
besides the collars that were about the necks of their camels.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah;
and all Israel played the harlot after it there, and it became a snare
to Gideon and to his family.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So Mid'ian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they lifted
up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days
of Gideon.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Jerubba'al the son of Jo'ash went and dwelt in his own house.
