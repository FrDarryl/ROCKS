"1" = ''':sup:`1` In the eighteenth year, on the twenty-second day of the first month,
there was talk in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians
about carrying out his revenge on the whole region, just as he said.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He called together all his officers and all his nobles and set forth
to them his secret plan and recounted fully, with his own lips, all the
wickedness of the region;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and it was decided that every one who had not obeyed his command
should be destroyed.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When he had finished setting forth his plan, Nebuchadnezzar king of
the Assyrians called Holofernes, the chief general of his army, second
only to himself, and said to him,
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` "Thus says the Great King, the lord of the whole earth: When you
leave my presence, take with you men confident in their strength, to
the number of one hundred and twenty thousand foot soldiers and twelve
thousand cavalry.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Go and attack the whole west country, because they disobeyed my
orders.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Tell them to prepare earth and water, for I am coming against them
in my anger, and will cover the whole face of the earth with the feet
of my armies, and will hand them over to be plundered by my troops,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` till their wounded shall fill their valleys, and every brook and
river shall be filled with their dead, and overflow;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` and I will lead them away captive to the ends of the whole earth.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` You shall go and seize all their territory for me in advance. They
will yield themselves to you, and you shall hold them for me till the
day of their punishment.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But if they refuse, your eye shall not spare and you shall hand
them over to slaughter and plunder throughout your whole region.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, what I have spoken
my hand will execute.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And you -- take care not to transgress any of your sovereign's
commands, but be sure to carry them out just as I have ordered you; and
do not delay about it."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So Holofernes left the presence of his master, and called together
all the commanders, generals, and officers of the Assyrian army,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and mustered the picked troops by divisions as his lord had ordered
him to do, one hundred and twenty thousand of them, together with
twelve thousand archers on horseback,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` and he organized them as a great army is marshaled for a campaign.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` He collected a vast number of camels and asses and mules for
transport, and innumerable sheep and oxen and goats for provision;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` also plenty of food for every man, and a huge amount of gold and
silver from the royal palace.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So he set out with his whole army, to go ahead of King
Nebuchadnezzar and to cover the whole face of the earth to the west
with their chariots and horsemen and picked troops of infantry.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Along with them went a mixed crowd like a swarm of locusts, like
the dust of the earth -- a multitude that could not be counted.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` They marched for three days from Nineveh to the plain of Bectileth,
and camped opposite Bectileth near the mountain which is to the north
of Upper Cilicia.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` From there Holofernes took his whole army, his infantry, cavalry,
and chariots, and went up into the hill country
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and ravaged Put and Lud, and plundered all the people of Rassis and
the Ishmaelites who lived along the desert, south of the country of the
Chelleans.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` Then he followed the Euphrates and passed through Mesopotamia and
destroyed all the hilltop cities along the brook Abron, as far as the
sea.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He also seized the territory of Cilicia, and killed every one who
resisted him, and came to the southern borders of Japheth, fronting
toward Arabia.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` He surrounded all the Midianites, and burned their tents and
plundered their sheepfolds.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then he went down into the plain of Damascus during the wheat
harvest, and burned all their fields and destroyed their flocks and
herds and sacked their cities and ravaged their lands and put to death
all their young men with the edge of the sword.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` So fear and terror of him fell upon all the people who lived along
the seacoast, at Sidon and Tyre, and those who lived in Sur and Ocina
and all who lived in Jamnia. Those who lived in Azotus and Ascalon
feared him exceedingly.
