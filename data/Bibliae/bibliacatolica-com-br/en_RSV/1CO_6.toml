to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints?

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the
world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?

"3" = ''':sup:`3` Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, matters
pertaining to this life!

"5" = ''':sup:`5` I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you
wise enough to decide between members of the brotherhood,

"6" = ''':sup:`6` but brother goes to law against brother, and that before
unbelievers?

"7" = ''':sup:`7` To have lawsuits at all with one another is defeat for you. Why not
rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?

"All things are lawful for me," but I will not be enslaved by anything.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` "Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food" -- and God
will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for
immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I
therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a
prostitute? Never!
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Do you not know that he who joins himself to a prostitute becomes
one body with her? For, as it is written, "The two shall become one
flesh."

"17" = ''':sup:`17` But he who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
