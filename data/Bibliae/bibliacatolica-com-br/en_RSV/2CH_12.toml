forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.

unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem

"3" = ''':sup:`3` with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. And the
people were without number who came with him from Egypt -- Libyans,
Suk'ki-im, and Ethiopians.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as
Jerusalem.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Then Shemai'ah the prophet came to Rehobo'am and to the princes of
Judah, who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to
them, "Thus says the LORD, `You abandoned me, so I have abandoned you
to the hand of Shishak.'"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said,
"The LORD is righteous."

"7" = ''':sup:`7` When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD
came to Shemai'ah: "They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy

"11" = ''':sup:`11` And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard
came and bore them, and brought them back to the guardroom.

so as not to make a complete destruction; moreover, conditions were
good in Judah.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` So King Rehobo'am established himself in Jerusalem and reigned.
Rehobo'am was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His
mother's name was Na'amah the Ammonitess.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` Now the acts of Rehobo'am, from first to last, are they not written
in the chronicles of Shemai'ah the prophet and of Iddo the seer? There

David; and Abi'jah his son reigned in his stead.
