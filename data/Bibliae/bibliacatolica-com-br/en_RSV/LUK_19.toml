"1" = ''':sup:`1` He entered Jericho and was passing through.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And there was a man named Zacchae'us; he was a chief tax collector,
and rich.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not, on account of the
crowd, because he was small of stature.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him,
for he was to pass that way.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him,
"Zacchae'us, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house
today."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So he made haste and came down, and received him joyfully.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And when they saw it they all murmured, "He has gone in to be the
guest of a man who is a sinner."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And Zacchae'us stood and said to the Lord, "Behold, Lord, the half
of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have defrauded any one of
anything, I restore it fourfold."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house,
since he also is a son of Abraham.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For the Son of man came to seek and to save the lost."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` As they heard these things, he proceeded to tell a parable, because
he was near to Jerusalem, and because they supposed that the kingdom of
God was to appear immediately.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` He said therefore, "A nobleman went into a far country to receive a
kingdom and then return.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten pounds, and said to
them, `Trade with these till I come.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him, saying,
`We do not want this man to reign over us.'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` When he returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded these
servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he
might know what they had gained by trading.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` The first came before him, saying, `Lord, your pound has made ten
pounds more.'
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And he said to him, `Well done, good servant! Because you have been
faithful in a very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the second came, saying, `Lord, your pound has made five
pounds.'
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he said to him, `And you are to be over five cities.'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then another came, saying, `Lord, here is your pound, which I kept
laid away in a napkin;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` for I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take up
what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He said to him, `I will condemn you out of your own mouth, you
wicked servant! You knew that I was a severe man, taking up what I did
not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Why then did you not put my money into the bank, and at my coming I
should have collected it with interest?'
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And he said to those who stood by, `Take the pound from him, and
give it to him who has the ten pounds.'
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` (And they said to him, `Lord, he has ten pounds!')
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` `I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from
him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over
them, bring them here and slay them before me.'"
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And when he had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` When he drew near to Beth'phage and Bethany, at the mount that is
called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` saying, "Go into the village opposite, where on entering you will
find a colt tied, on which no one has ever yet sat; untie it and bring
it here.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` If any one asks you, `Why are you untying it?' you shall say this,
`The Lord has need of it.'"
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` So those who were sent went away and found it as he had told them.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, "Why
are you untying the colt?"
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And they said, "The Lord has need of it."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their garments on the
colt they set Jesus upon it.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And as he rode along, they spread their garments on the road.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` As he was now drawing near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives,
the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God
with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` saying, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!
Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And some of the Pharisees in the multitude said to him, "Teacher,
rebuke your disciples."
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` He answered, "I tell you, if these were silent, the very stones
would cry out."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` saying, "Would that even today you knew the things that make for
peace! But now they are hid from your eyes.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` For the days shall come upon you, when your enemies will cast up a
bank about you and surround you, and hem you in on every side,
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` and dash you to the ground, you and your children within you, and
they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not
know the time of your visitation."
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` saying to them, "It is written, `My house shall be a house of
prayer'; but you have made it a den of robbers."
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` And he was teaching daily in the temple. The chief priests and the
scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him;
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` but they did not find anything they could do, for all the people
hung upon his words.
