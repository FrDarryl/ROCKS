have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours in the righteousness
of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and
of Jesus our Lord.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life
and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own
glory and excellence,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises,
that through these you may escape from the corruption that is in the
world because of passion, and become partakers of the divine nature.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For this very reason make every effort to supplement your faith with
virtue, and virtue with knowledge,
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with
steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness,

"7" = ''':sup:`7` and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with
love.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For if these things are yours and abound, they keep you from being
ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For whoever lacks these things is blind and shortsighted and has
forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Therefore, brethren, be the more zealous to confirm your call and
election, for if you do this you will never fall;
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` so there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the
eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Therefore I intend always to remind you of these things, though you
know them and are established in the truth that you have.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to arouse you by
way of reminder,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, as our
Lord Jesus Christ showed me.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And I will see to it that after my departure you may be able at any
time to recall these things.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to
you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were
eyewitnesses of his majesty.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For when he received honor and glory from God the Father and the
voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, "This is my beloved Son,
with whom I am well pleased,"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` we heard this voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the
holy mountain.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And we have the prophetic word made more sure. You will do well to
pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the
day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of
scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` because no prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved
by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
