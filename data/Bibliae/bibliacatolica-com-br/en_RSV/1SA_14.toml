[14]
"1" = ''':sup:`1` One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his
armor, "Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on yonder
side." But he did not tell his father.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gib'e-ah under the pomegranate
tree which is at Migron; the people who were with him were about six
hundred men,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and Ahi'jah the son of Ahi'tub, Ich'abod's brother, son of
Phin'ehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an
ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` In the pass, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine
garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on
the other side; the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the
other Seneh.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other
on the south in front of Geba.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, let us
go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the LORD
will work for us; for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many
or by few."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And his armor-bearer said to him, "Do all that your mind inclines
to; behold, I am with you, as is your mind so is mine."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then said Jonathan, "Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we
will show ourselves to them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` If they say to us, `Wait until we come to you,' then we will stand
still in our place, and we will not go up to them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But if they say, `Come up to us,' then we will go up; for the LORD
has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the
Philistines; and the Philistines said, "Look, Hebrews are coming out of
the holes where they have hid themselves."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer,
and said, "Come up to us, and we will show you a thing." And Jonathan
said to his armor-bearer, "Come up after me; for the LORD has given
them into the hand of Israel."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his
armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his
armor-bearer killed them after him;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made,
was of about twenty men within as it were half a furrow's length in an
acre of land.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the
people; the garrison and even the raiders trembled; the earth quaked;
and it became a very great panic.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the watchmen of Saul in Gib'e-ah of Benjamin looked; and
behold, the multitude was surging hither and thither.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then Saul said to the people who were with him, "Number and see who
has gone from us." And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his
armor-bearer were not there.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And Saul said to Ahi'jah, "Bring hither the ark of God." For the
ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of
the Philistines increased more and more; and Saul said to the priest,
"Withdraw your hand."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went
into the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow,
and there was very great confusion.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time
and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to
be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the
hill country of E'phraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they
too followed hard after them in the battle.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` So the LORD delivered Israel that day; and the battle passed beyond
Beth-a'ven.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul laid an
oath on the people, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats food until it
is evening and I am avenged on my enemies." So none of the people
tasted food.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the
ground.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was
dropping, but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared
the oath.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the
oath; so he put forth the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and
dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes
became bright.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then one of the people said, "Your father strictly charged the
people with an oath, saying, `Cursed be the man who eats food this
day.'" And the people were faint.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land; see how my
eyes have become bright, because I tasted a little of this honey.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil
of their enemies which they found; for now the slaughter among the
Philistines has not been great."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to
Ai'jalon. And the people were very faint;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves,
and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Then they told Saul, "Behold, the people are sinning against the
LORD, by eating with the blood." And he said, "You have dealt
treacherously; roll a great stone to me here."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to
them, `Let every man bring his ox or his sheep, and slay them here, and
eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" So
every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slew
them there.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he
built to the LORD.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and
despoil them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them."
And they said, "Do whatever seems good to you." But the priest said,
"Let us draw near hither to God."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines?
Wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him
that day.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And Saul said, "Come hither, all you leaders of the people; and
know and see how this sin has arisen today.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my
son, he shall surely die." But there was not a man among all the people
that answered him.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Then he said to all Israel, "You shall be on one side, and I and
Jonathan my son will be on the other side." And the people said to
Saul, "Do what seems good to you."
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Therefore Saul said, "O LORD God of Israel, why hast thou not
answered thy servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my
son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim; but if this guilt is in thy
people Israel, give Thummim." And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the
people escaped.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Then Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan." And
Jonathan was taken.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." And
Jonathan told him, "I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff
that was in my hand; here I am, I will die."
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And Saul said, "God do so to me and more also; you shall surely
die, Jonathan."
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Then the people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought
this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there
shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought
with God this day." So the people ransomed Jonathan, that he did not
die.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines; and the
Philistines went to their own place.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all
his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against
Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; wherever
he turned he put them to the worse.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And he did valiantly, and smote the Amal'ekites, and delivered
Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Mal'chishu'a; and
the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born
was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal;
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` and the name of Saul's wife was Ahin'o-am the daughter of
Ahim'a-az. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son
of Ner, Saul's uncle;
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the
son of Abi'el.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of
Saul; and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached
him to himself.

14:6-7 - Jonathan, Saul's son, demonstrates faith by attacking the
