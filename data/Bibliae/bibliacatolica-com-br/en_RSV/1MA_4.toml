"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now Gorgias took five thousand infantry and a thousand picked
cavalry, and this division moved out by night
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` to fall upon the camp of the Jews and attack them suddenly. Men from
the citadel were his guides.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But Judas heard of it, and he and his mighty men moved out to attack
the king's force in Emmaus
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` while the division was still absent from the camp.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` When Gorgias entered the camp of Judas by night, he found no one
there, so he looked for them in the hills, because he said, "These men
are fleeing from us."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` At daybreak Judas appeared in the plain with three thousand men, but
they did not have armor and swords such as they desired.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And they saw the camp of the Gentiles, strong and fortified, with
cavalry round about it; and these men were trained in war.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But Judas said to the men who were with him, "Do not fear their
numbers or be afraid when they charge.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Remember how our fathers were saved at the Red Sea, when Pharaoh
with his forces pursued them.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And now let us cry to Heaven, to see whether he will favor us and
remember his covenant with our fathers and crush this army before us
today.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then all the Gentiles will know that there is one who redeems and
saves Israel."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` When the foreigners looked up and saw them coming against them,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` they went forth from their camp to battle. Then the men with Judas
blew their trumpets
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and engaged in battle. The Gentiles were crushed and fled into the
plain,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and all those in the rear fell by the sword. They pursued them to
Gazara, and to the plains of Idumea, and to Azotus and Jamnia; and
three thousand of them fell.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then Judas and his force turned back from pursuing them,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` and he said to the people, "Do not be greedy for plunder, for there
is a battle before us;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Gorgias and his force are near us in the hills. But stand now
against our enemies and fight them, and afterward seize the plunder
boldly."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Just as Judas was finishing this speech, a detachment appeared,
coming out of the hills.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` They saw that their army had been put to flight, and that the Jews
were burning the camp, for the smoke that was seen showed what had
happened.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` When they perceived this they were greatly frightened, and when
they also saw the army of Judas drawn up in the plain for battle,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` they all fled into the land of the Philistines.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then Judas returned to plunder the camp, and they seized much gold
and silver, and cloth dyed blue and sea purple, and great riches.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` On their return they sang hymns and praises to Heaven, for he is
good, for his mercy endures for ever.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Those of the foreigners who escaped went and reported to Lysias all
that had happened.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` When he heard it, he was perplexed and discouraged, for things had
not happened to Israel as he had intended, nor had they turned out as
the king had commanded him.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But the next year he mustered sixty thousand picked infantrymen and
five thousand cavalry to subdue them.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` They came into Idumea and encamped at Beth-zur, and Judas met them
with ten thousand men.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` When he saw that the army was strong, he prayed, saying, "Blessed
art thou, O Savior of Israel, who didst crush the attack of the mighty
warrior by the hand of thy servant David, and didst give the camp of
the Philistines into the hands of Jonathan, the son of Saul, and of the
man who carried his armor.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` So do thou hem in this army by the hand of thy people Israel, and
let them be ashamed of their troops and their cavalry.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Fill them with cowardice; melt the boldness of their strength; let
them tremble in their destruction.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Strike them down with the sword of those who love thee, and let all
who know thy name praise thee with hymns."
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Then both sides attacked, and there fell of the army of Lysias five
thousand men; they fell in action.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And when Lysias saw the rout of his troops and observed the
boldness which inspired those of Judas, and how ready they were either
to live or to die nobly, he departed to Antioch and enlisted
mercenaries, to invade Judea again with an even larger army.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Then said Judas and his brothers, "Behold, our enemies are crushed;
let us go up to cleanse the sanctuary and dedicate it."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` So all the army assembled and they went up to Mount Zion.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And they saw the sanctuary desolate, the altar profaned, and the
gates burned. In the courts they saw bushes sprung up as in a thicket,
or as on one of the mountains. They saw also the chambers of the
priests in ruins.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Then they rent their clothes, and mourned with great lamentation,
and sprinkled themselves with ashes.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` They fell face down on the ground, and sounded the signal on the
trumpets, and cried out to Heaven.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then Judas detailed men to fight against those in the citadel until
he had cleansed the sanctuary.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` He chose blameless priests devoted to the law,
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` and they cleansed the sanctuary and removed the defiled stones to
an unclean place.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` They deliberated what to do about the altar of burnt offering,
which had been profaned.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And they thought it best to tear it down, lest it bring reproach
upon them, for the Gentiles had defiled it. So they tore down the
altar,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` and stored the stones in a convenient place on the temple hill
until there should come a prophet to tell what to do with them.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Then they took unhewn stones, as the law directs, and built a new
altar like the former one.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` They also rebuilt the sanctuary and the interior of the temple, and
consecrated the courts.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` They made new holy vessels, and brought the lampstand, the altar of
incense, and the table into the temple.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` Then they burned incense on the altar and lighted the lamps on the
lampstand, and these gave light in the temple.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` They placed the bread on the table and hung up the curtains. Thus
they finished all the work they had undertaken.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Early in the morning on the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month,
which is the month of Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-eighth
year,
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` they rose and offered sacrifice, as the law directs, on the new
altar of burnt offering which they had built.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` At the very season and on the very day that the Gentiles had
profaned it, it was dedicated with songs and harps and lutes and
cymbals.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` All the people fell on their faces and worshiped and blessed
Heaven, who had prospered them.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` So they celebrated the dedication of the altar for eight days, and
offered burnt offerings with gladness; they offered a sacrifice of
deliverance and praise.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` They decorated the front of the temple with golden crowns and small
shields; they restored the gates and the chambers for the priests, and
furnished them with doors.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` There was very great gladness among the people, and the reproach of
the Gentiles was removed.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` Then Judas and his brothers and all the assembly of Israel
determined that every year at that season the days of dedication of the
altar should be observed with gladness and joy for eight days,
beginning with the twenty-fifth day of the month of Chislev.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` At that time they fortified Mount Zion with high walls and strong
towers round about, to keep the Gentiles from coming and trampling them
down as they had done before.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` And he stationed a garrison there to hold it. He also fortified
Beth-zur, so that the people might have a stronghold that faced Idumea.
