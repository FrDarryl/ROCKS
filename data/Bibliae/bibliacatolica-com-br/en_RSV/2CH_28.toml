"1" = ''':sup:`1` Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
sixteen years in Jerusalem. And he did not do what was right in the
eyes of the LORD, like his father David,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel. He even made molten
images for the Ba'als;
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burned
his sons as an offering, according to the abominable practices of the
nations whom the LORD drove out before the people of Israel.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, and on the
hills, and under every green tree.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Therefore the LORD his God gave him into the hand of the king of
Syria, who defeated him and took captive a great number of his people
and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hand of the
king of Israel, who defeated him with great slaughter.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For Pekah the son of Remali'ah slew a hundred and twenty thousand in
Judah in one day, all of them men of valor, because they had forsaken
the LORD, the God of their fathers.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Zichri, a mighty man of E'phraim, slew Ma-asei'ah the king's son
and Azri'kam the commander of the palace and Elka'nah the next in
authority to the king.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The men of Israel took captive two hundred thousand of their
kinsfolk, women, sons, and daughters; they also took much spoil from
them and brought the spoil to Sama'ria.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded; and he
went out to meet the army that came to Sama'ria, and said to them,
"Behold, because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with
Judah, he gave them into your hand, but you have slain them in a rage
which has reached up to heaven.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And now you intend to subjugate the people of Judah and Jerusalem,
male and female, as your slaves. Have you not sins of your own against
the LORD your God?
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now hear me, and send back the captives from your kinsfolk whom you
have taken, for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Certain chiefs also of the men of E'phraim, Azari'ah the son of
Joha'nan, Berechi'ah the son of Meshil'lemoth, Jehizki'ah the son of
Shallum, and Ama'sa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who were
coming from the war,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and said to them, "You shall not bring the captives in here, for
you propose to bring upon us guilt against the LORD in addition to our
present sins and guilt. For our guilt is already great, and there is
fierce wrath against Israel."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes
and all the assembly.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And the men who have been mentioned by name rose and took the
captives, and with the spoil they clothed all that were naked among
them; they clothed them, gave them sandals, provided them with food and
drink, and anointed them; and carrying all the feeble among them on
asses, they brought them to their kinsfolk at Jericho, the city of palm
trees. Then they returned to Sama'ria.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` For the E'domites had again invaded and defeated Judah, and carried
away captives.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the Philistines had made raids on the cities in the Shephe'lah
and the Negeb of Judah, and had taken Beth-she'mesh, Ai'jalon,
Gede'roth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo
with its villages; and they settled there.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for
he had dealt wantonly in Judah and had been faithless to the LORD.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` So Til'gath-pilne'ser king of Assyria came against him, and
afflicted him instead of strengthening him.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For Ahaz took from the house of the LORD and the house of the king
and of the princes, and gave tribute to the king of Assyria; but it did
not help him.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` In the time of his distress he became yet more faithless to the
LORD -- this same King Ahaz.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him,
and said, "Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, I will
sacrifice to them that they may help me." But they were the ruin of
him, and of all Israel.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut
in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and he shut up the doors of
the house of the LORD; and he made himself altars in every corner of
Jerusalem.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other
gods, provoking to anger the LORD, the God of his fathers.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last,
behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city,
in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of
Israel. And Hezeki'ah his son reigned in his stead.

28:1-4 - Ahaz, son of Jotham, does what is evil in God's sight by
imitating pagan practices. This emphasizes how disobedience and

16:1-4 and Deuteronomy 8:19-20).
28:5-7 - Ahaz faces defeat in battle and, in his distress, seeks help
from the Syrians instead of trusting in God. This decision highlights
the lack of faith and the human tendency to look for solutions in the

prophet Oded urges Ahaz to release those captured. This illustrates the
