Notas de rodap√©:
20:1-3 - Hezekiah falls gravely ill and prays to the Lord for mercy.
His sincere and repentant prayer reveals the power of personal prayer
5:15-16).
20:4-6 - God hears Hezekiah's prayer and promises to heal him and give
him 15 more years of life. This reinforces the idea that God answers
prayers and has power over life and death (see also 1 Kings 17:21-22
20:8-11 - Hezekiah asks for a sign to confirm his healing, and God
causes the shadow on the sundial to move back. This miracle is a
demonstration of God's sovereign control over time and nature (see also
20:12-13 - Babylonian ambassadors visit Hezekiah, and he displays all
the riches of his kingdom. Hezekiah's lack of discernment in this
20:16-18 - Isaiah prophesies that Babylon will take everything Hezekiah
showed him, including his descendants. This prophecy marks the
beginning of the end of Judah and the coming of the Babylonian exile
