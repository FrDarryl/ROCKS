of the Red Sea, as the LORD told me; and for many days we went about
Mount Se'ir.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then the LORD said to me,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` `You have been going about this mountain country long enough; turn
northward.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` And command the people, You are about to pass through the territory
of your brethren the sons of Esau, who live in Se'ir; and they will be
afraid of you. So take good heed;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` do not contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land,
no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have
given Mount Se'ir to Esau as a possession.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat; and
you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.

"7" = ''':sup:`7` For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands;
he knows your going through this great wilderness; these forty years
the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.'

"8" = ''':sup:`8` So we went on, away from our brethren the sons of Esau who live in
Se'ir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and E'zion-ge'ber. "And we
turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the LORD said to me, `Do not harass Moab or contend with them in
battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession,

call them Emim.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` The Horites also lived in Se'ir formerly, but the sons of Esau
dispossessed them, and destroyed them from before them, and settled in
their stead; as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the
LORD gave to them.)

"13" = ''':sup:`13` `Now rise up, and go over the brook Zered.' So we went over the
brook Zered.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the time from our leaving Ka'desh-bar'nea until we crossed the
brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that
is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn
to them.

"15" = ''':sup:`15` For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them
from the camp, until they had perished.

the people,

"17" = ''':sup:`17` the LORD said to me,

"19" = ''':sup:`19` and when you approach the frontier of the sons of Ammon, do not

there, but the Ammonites call them Zamzum'mim,

destroyed them before them; and they dispossessed them, and settled in
their stead;

"22" = ''':sup:`22` as he did for the sons of Esau, who live in Se'ir, when he
destroyed the Horites before them, and they dispossessed them, and
settled in their stead even to this day.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the
Caph'torim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their

"24" = ''':sup:`24` `Rise up, take your journey, and go over the valley of the Arnon;
behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon,

"25" = ''':sup:`25` This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the
peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of
you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'

"26" = ''':sup:`26` "So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Ked'emoth to Sihon the
king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,

turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.

"29" = ''':sup:`29` as the sons of Esau who live in Se'ir and the Moabites who live in
Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land which the LORD
our God gives to us.'

"30" = ''':sup:`30` But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the
LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he
might give him into your hand, as at this day.

"31" = ''':sup:`31` And the LORD said to me, `Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and
his land over to you; begin to take possession, that you may occupy his
land.'

"32" = ''':sup:`32` Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at
Jahaz.

"33" = ''':sup:`33` And the LORD our God gave him over to us; and we defeated him and
his sons and all his people.

"34" = ''':sup:`34` And we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed
every city, men, women, and children; we left none remaining;

the cities which we captured.

"36" = ''':sup:`36` From Aro'er, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and
