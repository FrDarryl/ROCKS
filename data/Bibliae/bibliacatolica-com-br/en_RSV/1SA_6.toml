"9" = ''':sup:`9` And watch; if it goes up on the way to its own land, to
Beth-she'mesh, then it is he who has done us this great harm; but if
not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us, it

guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for
Ash'kelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` also the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of
the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and
unwalled villages. The great stone, beside which they set down the ark
of the LORD, is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of
Beth-she'mesh.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` And he slew some of the men of Beth-she'mesh, because they looked
into the ark of the LORD; he slew seventy men of them, and the people
mourned because the LORD had made a great slaughter among the people.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kir'iath-je'arim,
saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down
and take it up to you."
