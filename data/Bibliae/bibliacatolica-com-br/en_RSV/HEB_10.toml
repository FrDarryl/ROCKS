"1" = ''':sup:`1` For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come
instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same
sacrifices which are continually offered year after year, make perfect
those who draw near.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered? If the
worshipers had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any
consciousness of sin.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take
away sins.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices
and offerings thou hast not desired, but a body hast thou prepared for
me;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` in burnt offerings and sin offerings thou hast taken no pleasure.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then I said, `Lo, I have come to do thy will, O God,' as it is
written of me in the roll of the book."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When he said above, "Thou hast neither desired nor taken pleasure in
sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings" (these
are offered according to the law),
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` then he added, "Lo, I have come to do thy will." He abolishes the
first in order to establish the second.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of
the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly
the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for
sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` then to wait until his enemies should be made a stool for his feet.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who
are sanctified.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,
says the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on
their minds,"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` then he adds, "I will remember their sins and their misdeeds no
more."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any
offering for sin.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the
sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` by the new and living way which he opened for us through the
curtain, that is, through his flesh,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with
our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies
washed with pure water.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for
he who promised is faithful;
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good
works,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but
encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing
near.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the
truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire which will
consume the adversaries.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy at the
testimony of two or three witnesses.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the man
who has spurned the Son of God, and profaned the blood of the covenant
by which he was sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` For we know him who said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay." And
again, "The Lord will judge his people."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you
endured a hard struggle with sufferings,
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and affliction, and
sometimes being partners with those so treated.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` For you had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted
the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had
a better possession and an abiding one.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great
reward.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` For you have need of endurance, so that you may do the will of God
and receive what is promised.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` "For yet a little while, and the coming one shall come and shall
not tarry;
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back,
my soul has no pleasure in him."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of
those who have faith and keep their souls.
