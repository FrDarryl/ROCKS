"3" = ''':sup:`3` As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their
asses.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` When they had gone but a short distance from the city, Joseph said
to his steward, "Up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them,
say to them, `Why have you returned evil for good? Why have you stolen
my silver cup?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he
divines? You have done wrong in so doing.'"
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far
be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Behold, the money which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we
brought back to you from the land of Canaan; how then should we steal
silver or gold from your lord's house?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` With whomever of your servants it be found, let him die, and we also
will be my lord's slaves."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` He said, "Let it be as you say: he with whom it is found shall be
my slave, and the rest of you shall be blameless."

man opened his sack.

they returned to the city.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still
there; and they fell before him to the ground.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done? Do you
not know that such a man as I can indeed divine?"
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And Judah said, "What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak?
Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your
servants; behold, we are my lord's slaves, both we and he also in whose
hand the cup has been found."
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But he said, "Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man
in whose hand the cup was found shall be my slave; but as for you, go
up in peace to your father."
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then Judah went up to him and said, "O my lord, let your servant, I
pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not your anger burn
against your servant; for you are like Pharaoh himself.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` My lord asked his servants, saying, `Have you a father, or a
brother?'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And we said to my lord, `We have a father, an old man, and a young
brother, the child of his old age; and his brother is dead, and he
alone is left of his mother's children; and his father loves him.'
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Then you said to your servants, `Bring him down to me, that I may
set my eyes upon him.'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` We said to my lord, `The lad cannot leave his father, for if he
should leave his father, his father would die.'

"23" = ''':sup:`23` Then you said to your servants, `Unless your youngest brother comes
down with you, you shall see my face no more.'
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When we went back to your servant my father we told him the words
of my lord.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And when our father said, `Go again, buy us a little food,'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` we said, `We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us,
then we will go down; for we cannot see the man's face unless our
youngest brother is with us.'
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Then your servant my father said to us, `You know that my wife bore
me two sons;
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` one left me, and I said, Surely he has been torn to pieces; and I
have never seen him since.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will
bring down my gray hairs in sorrow to Sheol.'
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Now therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the lad
is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the lad's life,

"31" = ''':sup:`31` when he sees that the lad is not with us, he will die; and your
servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with
sorrow to Sheol.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying,
`If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame in the
sight of my father all my life.'
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Now therefore, let your servant, I pray you, remain instead of the
lad as a slave to my lord; and let the lad go back with his brothers.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` For how can I go back to my father if the lad is not with me? I
fear to see the evil that would come upon my father."
