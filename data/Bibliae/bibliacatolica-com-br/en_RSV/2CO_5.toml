"1" = ''':sup:`1` For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we
have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Here indeed we groan, and long to put on our heavenly dwelling,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` so that by putting it on we may not be found naked.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For while we are still in this tent, we sigh with anxiety; not that
we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that
what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us
the Spirit as a guarantee.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So we are always of good courage; we know that while we are at home
in the body we are away from the Lord,
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` for we walk by faith, not by sight.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` We are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body
and at home with the Lord.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that
each one may receive good or evil, according to what he has done in the

"12" = ''':sup:`12` We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause
to be proud of us, so that you may be able to answer those who pride
themselves on a man's position and not on his heart.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our
right mind, it is for you.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For the love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced that
one has died for all; therefore all have died.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he died for all, that those who live might live no longer for
themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of
view; even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view,
we regard him thus no longer.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Therefore, if any one is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old
has passed away, behold, the new has come.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself
and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not
counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the
message of reconciliation.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us.
We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him
we might become the righteousness of God.
