to me, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who is
seated upon many waters,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and
with the wine of whose fornication the dwellers on earth have become
drunk."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a
woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of blasphemous names,
and it had seven heads and ten horns.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and bedecked with gold
and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of
abominations and the impurities of her fornication;
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` and on her forehead was written a name of mystery: "Babylon the
great, mother of harlots and of earth's abominations."
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and the
blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her I marveled greatly.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But the angel said to me, "Why marvel? I will tell you the mystery
of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that
carries her.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is to ascend from the
bottomless pit and go to perdition; and the dwellers on earth whose
names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of
the world, will marvel to behold the beast, because it was and is not
and is to come.

mountains on which the woman is seated;

other has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain only a little
while.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it
belongs to the seven, and it goes to perdition.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet
received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for
one hour, together with the beast.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` These are of one mind and give over their power and authority to
the beast;
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` they will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for
he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called
and chosen and faithful."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he said to me, "The waters that you saw, where the harlot is
seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the
harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and
burn her up with fire,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by
being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast, until
the words of God shall be fulfilled.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And the woman that you saw is the great city which has dominion
over the kings of the earth."
