remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you
followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.

who ate of it became guilty; evil came upon them, says the LORD."

"4" = ''':sup:`4` Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of
the house of Israel.

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Thus says the LORD: "What wrong did your fathers find in me that
they went far from me, and went after worthlessness, and became
worthless?
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` They did not say, `Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land
of Egypt, who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits,
in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that none passes

"7" = ''':sup:`7` And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and its
good things. But when you came in you defiled my land, and made my
heritage an abomination.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The priests did not say, `Where is the LORD?' Those who handle the

'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate,
says the LORD,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the

broken cisterns, that can hold no water.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` And now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of
the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria, to drink the waters

LORD your God; the fear of me is not in you, says the Lord GOD of
hosts.

"20" = ''':sup:`20` "For long ago you broke your yoke and burst your bonds; and you
said, `I will not serve.' Yea, upon every high hill and under every
green tree you bowed down as a harlot.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` Yet I planted you a choice vine, wholly of pure seed. How then have
you turned degenerate and become a wild vine?

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of
your guilt is still before me, says the Lord GOD.

"23" = ''':sup:`23` How can you say, `I am not defiled, I have not gone after the
Ba'als'? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done -- a
restive young camel interlacing her tracks,

"24" = ''':sup:`24` a wild ass used to the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind!
Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in
her month they will find her.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But
you said, `It is hopeless, for I have loved strangers, and after them I
will go.'
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` "As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel shall be
shamed: they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their
prophets,

"27" = ''':sup:`27` who say to a tree, `You are my father,' and to a stone, `You gave
me birth.' For they have turned their back to me, and not their face.
But in the time of their trouble they say, `Arise and save us!'

"30" = ''':sup:`30` In vain have I smitten your children, they took no correction; your
own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And you, O generation, heed the word of the LORD. Have I been a
wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why then do my
people say, `We are free, we will come no more to thee'?
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` Can a maiden forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my
people have forgotten me days without number.

wicked women you have taught your ways.

Behold, I will bring you to judgment for saying, `I have not sinned.'

shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.
