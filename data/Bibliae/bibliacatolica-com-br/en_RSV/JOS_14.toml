them.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` For the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manas'seh and E'phraim;

substance.

forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses,
while Israel walked in the wilderness; and now, lo, I am this day
eighty-five years old.

"11" = ''':sup:`11` I am still as strong to this day as I was in the day that Moses
sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war, and for
going and coming.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that
day; for you heard on that day how the Anakim were there, with great

the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.
