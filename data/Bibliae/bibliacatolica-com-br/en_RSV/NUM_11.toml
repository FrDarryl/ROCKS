"1" = ''':sup:`1` And the people complained in the hearing of the LORD about their
misfortunes; and when the LORD heard it, his anger was kindled, and the
fire of the LORD burned among them, and consumed some outlying parts of
the camp.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to the LORD, and
the fire abated.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` So the name of that place was called Tab'erah, because the fire of
the LORD burned among them.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` Now the rabble that was among them had a strong craving; and the
people of Israel also wept again, and said, "O that we had meat to eat!
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` We remember the fish we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, the
melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` but now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but
this manna to look at."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that
of bdellium.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` The people went about and gathered it, and ground it in mills or
beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it; and
the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with
it.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man
at the door of his tent; and the anger of the LORD blazed hotly, and
Moses was displeased.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Moses said to the LORD, "Why hast thou dealt ill with thy servant?
And why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou dost lay the
burden of all this people upon me?
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Did I conceive all this people? Did I bring them forth, that thou
shouldst say to me, `Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries the
sucking child, to the land which thou didst swear to give their
fathers?'
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep
before me and say, `Give us meat, that we may eat.'
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` I am not able to carry all this people alone, the burden is too
heavy for me.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` If thou wilt deal thus with me, kill me at once, if I find favor in
thy sight, that I may not see my wretchedness."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the LORD said to Moses, "Gather for me seventy men of the
elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and
officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them
take their stand there with you.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And I will come down and talk with you there; and I will take some
of the spirit which is upon you and put it upon them; and they shall
bear the burden of the people with you, that you may not bear it
yourself alone.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And say to the people, `Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you
shall eat meat; for you have wept in the hearing of the LORD, saying,
"Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt."
Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You shall not eat one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days,
or twenty days,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes
loathsome to you, because you have rejected the LORD who is among you,
and have wept before him, saying, "Why did we come forth out of
Egypt?"'"
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But Moses said, "The people among whom I am number six hundred
thousand on foot; and thou hast said, `I will give them meat, that they
may eat a whole month!'
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to suffice them? Or
shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice
them?"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And the LORD said to Moses, "Is the LORD's hand shortened? Now you
shall see whether my word will come true for you or not."
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` So Moses went out and told the people the words of the LORD; and he
gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and placed them round
about the tent.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took
some of the spirit that was upon him and put it upon the seventy
elders; and when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But they
did so no more.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other
named Medad, and the spirit rested upon them; they were among those
registered, but they had not gone out to the tent, and so they
prophesied in the camp.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And a young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are
prophesying in the camp."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen
men, said, "My lord Moses, forbid them."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` But Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all
the LORD's people were prophets, that the LORD would put his spirit
upon them!"
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and it brought quails
from the sea, and let them fall beside the camp, about a day's journey
on this side and a day's journey on the other side, round about the
camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And the people rose all that day, and all night, and all the next
day, and gathered the quails; he who gathered least gathered ten
homers; and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed,
the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD
smote the people with a very great plague.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Therefore the name of that place was called Kib'roth-hatta'avah,
because there they buried the people who had the craving.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` From Kib'roth-hatta'avah the people journeyed to Haze'roth; and
they remained at Haze'roth.
