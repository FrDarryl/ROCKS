"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?" Then he led me
back along the bank of the river.

kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit
fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for
them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their
leaves for healing."
