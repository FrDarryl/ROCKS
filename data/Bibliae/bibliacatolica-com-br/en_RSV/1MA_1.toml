"1" = ''':sup:`1` After Alexander son of Philip, the Macedonian, who came from the

Medes, he succeeded him as king. (He had previously become king of

"2" = ''':sup:`2` He fought many battles, conquered strongholds, and put to death the
kings of the earth.

'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Then his officers began to rule, each in his own place.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` They all put on crowns after his death, and so did their sons after

Antiochus the king; he had been a hostage in Rome. He began to reign in
the one hundred and thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` In those days lawless men came forth from Israel, and misled many,
saying, "Let us go and make a covenant with the Gentiles round about
us, for since we separated from them many evils have come upon us."
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` This proposal pleased them,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and some of the people eagerly went to the king. He authorized them
to observe the ordinances of the Gentiles.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, according to Gentile
custom,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and removed the marks of circumcision, and abandoned the holy
covenant. They joined with the Gentiles and sold themselves to do evil.

'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He took also the table for the bread of the Presence, the cups for

"26" = ''':sup:`26` rulers and elders groaned, maidens and young men became faint, the
beauty of women faded.

chamber was mourning.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Even the land shook for its inhabitants, and all the house of Jacob
was clothed with shame.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Two years later the king sent to the cities of Judah a chief
collector of tribute, and he came to Jerusalem with a large force.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Deceitfully he spoke peaceable words to them, and they believed

destroyed many people of Israel.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` He plundered the city, burned it with fire, and tore down its
houses and its surrounding walls.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And they took captive the women and children, and seized the
cattle.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Then they fortified the city of David with a great strong wall and
strong towers, and it became their citadel.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And they stationed there a sinful people, lawless men. These
strengthened their position;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` they stored up arms and food, and collecting the spoils of
Jerusalem they stored them there, and became a great snare.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` It became an ambush against the sanctuary, an evil adversary of
Israel continually.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` On every side of the sanctuary they shed innocent blood; they even
defiled the sanctuary.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Because of them the residents of Jerusalem fled; she became a
dwelling of strangers; she became strange to her offspring, and her
children forsook her.

into mourning, her sabbaths into a reproach, her honor into contempt.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Her dishonor now grew as great as her glory; her exaltation was
turned into mourning.

"41" = ''':sup:`41` Then the king wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one
people,
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` and that each should give up his customs.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` All the Gentiles accepted the command of the king. Many even from
Israel gladly adopted his religion; they sacrificed to idols and
profaned the sabbath.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` And the king sent letters by messengers to Jerusalem and the cities
of Judah; he directed them to follow customs strange to the land,
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` to forbid burnt offerings and sacrifices and drink offerings in the
sanctuary, to profane sabbaths and feasts,
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` to defile the sanctuary and the priests,
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` to build altars and sacred precincts and shrines for idols, to
sacrifice swine and unclean animals,
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` and to leave their sons uncircumcised. They were to make themselves
abominable by everything unclean and profane,
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` so that they should forget the law and change all the ordinances.
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` "And whoever does not obey the command of the king shall die."
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` In such words he wrote to his whole kingdom. And he appointed
inspectors over all the people and commanded the cities of Judah to
offer sacrifice, city by city.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` Many of the people, every one who forsook the law, joined them, and
they did evil in the land;

"53" = ''':sup:`53` they drove Israel into hiding in every place of refuge they had.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` Now on the fifteenth day of Chislev, in the one hundred and
forty-fifth year, they erected a desolating sacrilege upon the altar of

'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` The books of the law which they found they tore to pieces and
burned with fire.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` Where the book of the covenant was found in the possession of any
one, or if any one adhered to the law, the decree of the king condemned
him to death.
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` They kept using violence against Israel, against those found month
after month in the cities.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` And on the twenty-fifth day of the month they offered sacrifice on
the altar which was upon the altar of burnt offering.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` According to the decree, they put to death the women who had their
children circumcised,
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` and their families and those who circumcised them; and they hung
the infants from their mothers' necks.
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` But many in Israel stood firm and were resolved in their hearts not
to eat unclean food.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` They chose to die rather than to be defiled by food or to profane
the holy covenant; and they did die.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` And very great wrath came upon Israel.
