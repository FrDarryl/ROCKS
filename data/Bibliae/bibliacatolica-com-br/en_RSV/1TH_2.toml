"1" = ''':sup:`1` For you yourselves know, brethren, that our visit to you was not in
vain;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` but though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at
Philip'pi, as you know, we had courage in our God to declare to you the
gospel of God in the face of great opposition.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For our appeal does not spring from error or uncleanness, nor is it
made with guile;
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the
gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but to please God who tests our
hearts.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For we never used either words of flattery, as you know, or a cloak
for greed, as God is witness;
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` nor did we seek glory from men, whether from you or from others,
though we might have made demands as apostles of Christ.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But we were gentle among you, like a nurse taking care of her
children.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share
with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because
you had become very dear to us.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For you remember our labor and toil, brethren; we worked night and
day, that we might not burden any of you, while we preached to you the
gospel of God.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and
blameless was our behavior to you believers;

"11" = ''':sup:`11` for you know how, like a father with his children, we exhorted each
one of you and encouraged you and charged you
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` to lead a life worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom
and glory.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received
the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the
word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work
in you believers.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in
Christ Jesus which are in Judea; for you suffered the same things from
your own countrymen as they did from the Jews,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out,
and displease God and oppose all men
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they may be
saved -- so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But God's
wrath has come upon them at last!
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But since we were bereft of you, brethren, for a short time, in
person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great
desire to see you face to face;
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` because we wanted to come to you -- I, Paul, again and again -- but
Satan hindered us.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord
Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For you are our glory and joy.
