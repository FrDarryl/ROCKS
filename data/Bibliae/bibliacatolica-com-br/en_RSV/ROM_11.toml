"1" = ''':sup:`1` I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! I myself am
an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of
Benjamin.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know
what the scripture says of Eli'jah, how he pleads with God against
Israel?
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` "Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have demolished thy
altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But what is God's reply to him? "I have kept for myself seven
thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Ba'al."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works;
otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` What then? Israel failed to obtain what it sought. The elect
obtained it, but the rest were hardened,
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that
should not see and ears that should not hear, down to this very day."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a
pitfall and a retribution for them;
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their
backs for ever."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? By no means! But
through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to
make Israel jealous.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their
failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full
inclusion mean!
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle
to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` in order to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of
them.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what
will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` If the dough offered as first fruits is holy, so is the whole lump;
and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive
shoot, were grafted in their place to share the richness of the olive
tree,
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember it is not
you that support the root, but the root that supports you.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` You will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted
in."
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but
you stand fast only through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in
awe.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he
spare you.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward
those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue
in his kindness; otherwise you too will be cut off.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And even the others, if they do not persist in their unbelief, will
be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For if you have been cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree,
and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much
more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive
tree.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand
this mystery, brethren: a hardening has come upon part of Israel, until
the full number of the Gentiles come in,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` and so all Israel will be saved; as it is written, "The Deliverer
will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob";
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` "and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their
sins."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but
as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received
mercy because of their disobedience,
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown
to you they also may receive mercy.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` For God has consigned all men to disobedience, that he may have
mercy upon all.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How
unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` "For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his
counselor?"
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` "Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?"

"36" = ''':sup:`36` For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be
glory for ever. Amen.

Notas de rodap√©:
11:1-6 - Paul affirms that God has not rejected Israel, for he himself,
as a Jew, is an example that God still maintains a faithful remnant.
Election by grace, not works, is the basis of salvation (see also 1
11:7-10 - Israel's unbelief does not hinder God's plan. He gave them a
spirit of perversion, but He did not completely abandon His people,
allowing the Gentiles to be incorporated into His plan of salvation
11:11-15 - The fall of Israel resulted in the salvation of the
Gentiles, but Paul points out that this is for the salvation of the
Jews as well. The introduction of the Gentiles to the gospel is a
blessing, but the ultimate goal is the restoration of Israel (see also
11:16-24 - Paul uses the metaphor of the olive tree to illustrate the
relationship between Jews and Gentiles. The Gentiles have been grafted
into the olive tree, but they must remain humble and watchful, for the
tree can be cut down if they do not remain faithful to the faith (see
11:25-36 - Paul speaks of the mystery of Israel's salvation and how the
Jews' partial blindness will be removed at the end of time. He
concludes with a hymn of praise to God's wisdom and sovereignty (see
