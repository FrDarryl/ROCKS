"1" = ''':sup:`1` Then the king of Egypt gathered great forces, like the sand by the
seashore, and many ships; and he tried to get possession of Alexander's
kingdom by trickery and add it to his own kingdom.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` He set out for Syria with peaceable words, and the people of the
cities opened their gates to him and went to meet him, for Alexander
the king had commanded them to meet him, since he was Alexander's
father-in-law.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But when Ptolemy entered the cities he stationed forces as a
garrison in each city.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` When he approached Azotus, they showed him the temple of Dagon
burned down, and Azotus and its suburbs destroyed, and the corpses
lying about, and the charred bodies of those whom Jonathan had burned
in the war, for they had piled them in heaps along his route.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` They also told the king what Jonathan had done, to throw blame on
him; but the king kept silent.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Jonathan met the king at Joppa with pomp, and they greeted one
another and spent the night there.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And Jonathan went with the king as far as the river called
Eleutherus; then he returned to Jerusalem.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` So King Ptolemy gained control of the coastal cities as far as
Seleucia by the sea, and he kept devising evil designs against
Alexander.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` He sent envoys to Demetrius the king, saying, "Come, let us make a
covenant with each other, and I will give you in marriage my daughter
who was Alexander's wife, and you shall reign over your father's
kingdom.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` For I now regret that I gave him my daughter, for he has tried to
kill me."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He threw blame on Alexander because he coveted his kingdom.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` So he took his daughter away from him and gave her to Demetrius. He
was estranged from Alexander, and their enmity became manifest.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then Ptolemy entered Antioch and put on the crown of Asia. Thus he
put two crowns upon his head, the crown of Egypt and that of Asia.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Now Alexander the king was in Cilicia at that time, because the
people of that region were in revolt.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And Alexander heard of it and came against him in battle. Ptolemy
marched out and met him with a strong force, and put him to flight.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` So Alexander fled into Arabia to find protection there, and King
Ptolemy was exalted.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Zabdiel the Arab cut off the head of Alexander and sent it to
Ptolemy.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` But King Ptolemy died three days later, and his troops in the
strongholds were killed by the inhabitants of the strongholds.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So Demetrius became king in the one hundred and sixty-seventh year.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` In those days Jonathan assembled the men of Judea to attack the
citadel in Jerusalem, and he built many engines of war to use against
it.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But certain lawless men who hated their nation went to the king and
reported to him that Jonathan was besieging the citadel.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` When he heard this he was angry, and as soon as he heard it he set
out and came to Ptolemais; and he wrote Jonathan not to continue the
siege, but to meet him for a conference at Ptolemais as quickly as
possible.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` When Jonathan heard this, he gave orders to continue the siege; and
he chose some of the elders of Israel and some of the priests, and put
himself in danger,
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` for he went to the king at Ptolemais, taking silver and gold and
clothing and numerous other gifts. And he won his favor.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Although certain lawless men of his nation kept making complaints
against him,
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` the king treated him as his predecessors had treated him; he
exalted him in the presence of all his friends.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` He confirmed him in the high priesthood and in as many other honors
as he had formerly had, and made him to be regarded as one of his chief
friends.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then Jonathan asked the king to free Judea and the three districts
of Samaria from tribute, and promised him three hundred talents.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` The king consented, and wrote a letter to Jonathan about all these
things; its contents were as follows:
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` "King Demetrius to Jonathan his brother and to the nation of the
Jews, greeting.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` This copy of the letter which we wrote concerning you to Lasthenes
our kinsman we have written to you also, so that you may know what it
says.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` `King Demetrius to Lasthenes his father, greeting.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` To the nation of the Jews, who are our friends and fulfil their
obligations to us, we have determined to do good, because of the good
will they show toward us.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` We have confirmed as their possession both the territory of Judea
and the three districts of Aphairema and Lydda and Rathamin; the
latter, with all the region bordering them, were added to Judea from
Samaria. To all those who offer sacrifice in Jerusalem, we have granted
release from the royal taxes which the king formerly received from them
each year, from the crops of the land and the fruit of the trees.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And the other payments henceforth due to us of the tithes, and the
taxes due to us, and the salt pits and the crown taxes due to us --
from all these we shall grant them release.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And not one of these grants shall be canceled from this time forth
for ever.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Now therefore take care to make a copy of this, and let it be given
to Jonathan and put up in a conspicuous place on the holy mountain.'"
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Now when Demetrius the king saw that the land was quiet before him
and that there was no opposition to him, he dismissed all his troops,
each man to his own place, except the foreign troops which he had
recruited from the islands of the nations. So all the troops who had
served his fathers hated him.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` Now Trypho had formerly been one of Alexander's supporters. He saw
that all the troops were murmuring against Demetrius. So he went to
Imalkue the Arab, who was bringing up Antiochus, the young son of
Alexander,
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` and insistently urged him to hand Antiochus over to him, to become
king in place of his father. He also reported to Imalkue what Demetrius
had done and told of the hatred which the troops of Demetrius had for
him; and he stayed there many days.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Now Jonathan sent to Demetrius the king the request that he remove
the troops of the citadel from Jerusalem, and the troops in the
strongholds; for they kept fighting against Israel.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And Demetrius sent this message to Jonathan, "Not only will I do
these things for you and your nation, but I will confer great honor on
you and your nation, if I find an opportunity.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Now then you will do well to send me men who will help me, for all
my troops have revolted."
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` So Jonathan sent three thousand stalwart men to him at Antioch, and
when they came to the king, the king rejoiced at their arrival.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` Then the men of the city assembled within the city, to the number
of a hundred and twenty thousand, and they wanted to kill the king.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` But the king fled into the palace. Then the men of the city seized
the main streets of the city and began to fight.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` So the king called the Jews to his aid, and they all rallied about
him and then spread out through the city; and they killed on that day
as many as a hundred thousand men.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` They set fire to the city and seized much spoil on that day, and
they saved the king.
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` When the men of the city saw that the Jews had gained control of
the city as they pleased, their courage failed and they cried out to
the king with this entreaty,
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` "Grant us peace, and make the Jews stop fighting against us and our
city."
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` And they threw down their arms and made peace. So the Jews gained
glory in the eyes of the king and of all the people in his kingdom, and
they returned to Jerusalem with much spoil.
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` So Demetrius the king sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the
land was quiet before him.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` But he broke his word about all that he had promised; and he became
estranged from Jonathan and did not repay the favors which Jonathan had
done him, but oppressed him greatly.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` After this Trypho returned, and with him the young boy Antiochus
who began to reign and put on the crown.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` All the troops that Demetrius had cast off gathered around him, and
they fought against Demetrius, and he fled and was routed.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` And Trypho captured the elephants and gained control of Antioch.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` Then the young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, "I confirm you
in the high priesthood and set you over the four districts and make you
one of the friends of the king."
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` And he sent him gold plate and a table service, and granted him the
right to drink from gold cups and dress in purple and wear a gold
buckle.
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` Simon his brother he made governor from the Ladder of Tyre to the
borders of Egypt.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` Then Jonathan set forth and traveled beyond the river and among the
cities, and all the army of Syria gathered to him as allies. When he
came to Askalon, the people of the city met him and paid him honor.
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` From there he departed to Gaza, but the men of Gaza shut him out.
So he beseiged it and burned its suburbs with fire and plundered them.
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` Then the people of Gaza pleaded with Jonathan, and he made peace
with them, and took the sons of their rulers as hostages and sent them
to Jerusalem. And he passed through the country as far as Damascus.
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` Then Jonathan heard that the officers of Demetrius had come to
Kadesh in Galilee with a large army, intending to remove him from
office.
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` He went to meet them, but left his brother Simon in the country.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` Simon encamped before Beth-zur and fought against it for many days
and hemmed it in.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` Then they asked him to grant them terms of peace, and he did so. He
removed them from there, took possession of the city, and set a
garrison over it.
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` Jonathan and his army encamped by the waters of Gennesaret. Early
in the morning they marched to the plain of Hazor,
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` and behold, the army of the foreigners met him in the plain; they
had set an ambush against him in the mountains, but they themselves met
him face to face.
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` Then the men in ambush emerged from their places and joined battle.
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` All the men with Jonathan fled; not one of them was left except
Mattathias the son of Absalom and Judas the son of Chalphi, commanders
of the forces of the army.
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` Jonathan rent his garments and put dust on his head, and prayed.
'''
"72" = ''':sup:`72` Then he turned back to the battle against the enemy and routed
them, and they fled.
'''
"73" = ''':sup:`73` When his men who were fleeing saw this, they returned to him and
joined him in the pursuit as far as Kadesh, to their camp, and there
they encamped.
'''
"74" = ''':sup:`74` As many as three thousand of the foreigners fell that day. And
Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.
