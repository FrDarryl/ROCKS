"19" = ''':sup:`19` And the Rab'shakeh said to them, "Say to Hezeki'ah, `Thus says the
great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this confidence of
yours?
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? On
whom do you now rely, that you have rebelled against me?
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Behold, you are relying now on Egypt, that broken reed of a staff,
which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh
king of Egypt to all who rely on him.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But if you say to me, "We rely on the LORD our God," is it not he
whose high places and altars Hezeki'ah has removed, saying to Judah and

give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set
riders upon them.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my
master's servants, when you rely on Egypt for chariots and for
horsemen?

place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and

"26" = ''':sup:`26` Then Eli'akim the son of Hilki'ah, and Shebnah, and Jo'ah, said to
the Rab'shakeh, "Pray, speak to your servants in the Aramaic language,
for we understand it; do not speak to us in the language of Judah
within the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` But the Rab'shakeh said to them, "Has my master sent me to speak
these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on
the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and to drink
their own urine?"
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then the Rab'shakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the
language of Judah: "Hear the word of the great king, the king of
Assyria!

not be able to deliver you out of my hand.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Do not let Hezeki'ah make you to rely on the LORD by saying, The
LORD will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the
hand of the king of Assyria.'
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Do not listen to Hezeki'ah; for thus says the king of Assyria:

eat of his own vine, and every one of his own fig tree, and every one
of you will drink the water of his own cistern;
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land
of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees
and honey, that you may live, and not die. And do not listen to
Hezeki'ah when he misleads you by saying, The LORD will deliver us.

the hand of the king of Assyria?
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of
Sepharva'im, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Sama'ria out of my
hand?
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` Who among all the gods of the countries have delivered their
countries out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of
my hand?'"
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` But the people were silent and answered him not a word, for the
king's command was, "Do not answer him."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Then Eli'akim the son of Hilki'ah, who was over the household, and
Shebna the secretary, and Jo'ah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to
Hezeki'ah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of the
Rab'shakeh.
