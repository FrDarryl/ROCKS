"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now King Solomon loved many foreign women: the daughter of Pharaoh,
and Moabite, Ammonite, E'domite, Sido'nian, and Hittite women,
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the people of
Israel, "You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall
they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their
gods"; Solomon clung to these in love.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other
gods; and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as was the
heart of David his father.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For Solomon went after Ash'toreth the goddess of the Sido'nians, and
after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not
wholly follow the LORD, as David his father had done.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab,
and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east
of Jerusalem.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and
sacrificed to their gods.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned
away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
after other gods; but he did not keep what the LORD commanded.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this has been your mind
and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes which I have
commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it
to your servant.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your
days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` However I will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one
tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of
Jerusalem which I have chosen."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the
E'domite; he was of the royal house in Edom.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` For when David was in Edom, and Jo'ab the commander of the army
went up to bury the slain, he slew every male in Edom
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` (for Jo'ab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had
cut off every male in Edom);
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` but Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain E'domites of his
father's servants, Hadad being yet a little child.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` They set out from Mid'ian and came to Paran, and took men with them
from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a
house, and assigned him an allowance of food, and gave him land.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of
Tah'penes the queen.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And the sister of Tah'penes bore him Genu'bath his son, whom
Tah'penes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genu'bath was in Pharaoh's
house among the sons of Pharaoh.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and
that Jo'ab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh,
"Let me depart, that I may go to my own country."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But Pharaoh said to him, "What have you lacked with me that you are
now seeking to go to your own country?" And he said to him, "Only let
me go."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of
Eli'ada, who had fled from his master Hadade'zer king of Zobah.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding
band, after the slaughter by David; and they went to Damascus, and
dwelt there, and made him king in Damascus.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing
mischief as Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, an E'phraimite of Zer'edah, a servant
of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeru'ah, a widow, also lifted up
his hand against the king.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king.
Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David
his father.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` The man Jerobo'am was very able, and when Solomon saw that the
young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor
of the house of Joseph.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And at that time, when Jerobo'am went out of Jerusalem, the prophet
Ahi'jah the Shi'lonite found him on the road. Now Ahi'jah had clad
himself with a new garment; and the two of them were alone in the open
country.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` Then Ahi'jah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore
it into twelve pieces.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And he said to Jerobo'am, "Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus
says the LORD, the God of Israel, `Behold, I am about to tear the
kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give you ten tribes
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` (but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and
for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the
tribes of Israel),
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` because he has forsaken me, and worshiped Ash'toreth the goddess of
the Sido'nians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the
Ammonites, and has not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my
sight and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, as David his father
did.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but
I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David
my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it
to you, ten tribes.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may
always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen
to put my name.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul
desires, and you shall be king over Israel.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` And if you will hearken to all that I command you, and will walk in
my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my
commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you, and will
build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to
you.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And I will for this afflict the descendants of David, but not for
ever.'"
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` Solomon sought therefore to kill Jerobo'am; but Jerobo'am arose,
and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until
the death of Solomon.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his
wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was
forty years.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
David his father; and Rehobo'am his son reigned in his stead.

Notas de rodap√©:
11:1-3 - Solomon disobeyed God by marrying numerous foreign women, who
ultimately turned his heart to other gods. His moral and spiritual
decline contrasted with the promising beginning of his reign and
demonstrated the danger of disobedience (see also Deuteronomy 7:3-4 and
11:4-6 - Solomon, now elderly, is led to worship other gods because of
his wives. His unfaithfulness to God marks the beginning of the
division of the kingdom of Israel. The impact of idolatry is profound,
even for a king so blessed with wisdom (see also Deuteronomy 17:17 and
11:9-13 - God is angry with Solomon for his straying and announces that
the kingdom will be divided. However, for David's sake, this division
will occur in the time of his son. Here we see the importance of the
Kings 12:15).
11:14-22 - God raises adversaries against Solomon, including Hadad the
Edomite. This growing opposition reflects divine judgment on the king
who strayed from obedience. The consequences of Solomon's sin begin to
11:26-40 - Jeroboam, Solomon's servant, is chosen by God to rule the
ten tribes of Israel. The prophet Ahijah symbolizes this division by
tearing his cloak into twelve pieces. This event marks the beginning of
Israel's political and spiritual division (see also 1 Kings 12:20 and
