"1" = ''':sup:`1` But Eli'sha said, "Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the LORD,
Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine meal shall be sold for a
shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, at the gate of
Sama'ria."

"2" = ''':sup:`2` Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned said to the man of
God, "If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could this
thing be?" But he said, "You shall see it with your own eyes, but you
shall not eat of it."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Now there were four men who were lepers at the entrance to the gate;
and they said to one another, "Why do we sit here till we die?
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` If we say, `Let us enter the city,' the famine is in the city, and
we shall die there; and if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let
us go over to the camp of the Syrians; if they spare our lives we shall
live, and if they kill us we shall but die."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; but when
they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no
one there.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of
chariots, and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said
to one another, "Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the
kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come upon us."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` So they fled away in the twilight and forsook their tents, their
horses, and their asses, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their
lives.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a
tent, and ate and drank, and they carried off silver and gold and
clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back, and entered
another tent, and carried off things from it, and went and hid them.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then they said to one another, "We are not doing right. This day is
a day of good news; if we are silent and wait until the morning light,
punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the
king's household."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told
them, "We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one
to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied, and the asses
tied, and the tents as they were."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king's
household.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And the king rose in the night, and said to his servants, "I will
tell you what the Syrians have prepared against us. They know that we
are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves
in the open country, thinking, `When they come out of the city, we
shall take them alive and get into the city.'"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And one of his servants said, "Let some men take five of the
remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like
the whole multitude of Israel that have already perished; let us send
and see."
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So they took two mounted men, and the king sent them after the army
of the Syrians, saying, "Go and see."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` So they went after them as far as the Jordan; and, lo, all the way
was littered with garments and equipment which the Syrians had thrown
away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Then the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So
a measure of fine meal was sold for a shekel, and two measures of
barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Now the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to
have charge of the gate; and the people trod upon him in the gate, so
that he died, as the man of God had said when the king came down to
him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` For when the man of God had said to the king, "Two measures of
barley shall be sold for a shekel, and a measure of fine meal for a
shekel, about this time tomorrow in the gate of Sama'ria,"
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` the captain had answered the man of God, "If the LORD himself
should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?" And he had said,
"You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it."

"20" = ''':sup:`20` And so it happened to him, for the people trod upon him in the gate
and he died.
