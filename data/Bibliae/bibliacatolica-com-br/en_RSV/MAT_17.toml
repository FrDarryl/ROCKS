him.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` And Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is well that we are here; if you

one for Eli'jah."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` He was still speaking, when lo, a bright cloud overshadowed them,
and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I
am well pleased; listen to him."

"6" = ''':sup:`6` When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were
filled with awe.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` But Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Rise, and have no fear."

"8" = ''':sup:`8` And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.

"9" = ''':sup:`9` And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them,
"Tell no one the vision, until the Son of man is raised from the dead."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the disciples asked him, "Then why do the scribes say that
first Eli'jah must come?"
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` He replied, "Eli'jah does come, and he is to restore all things;
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` but I tell you that Eli'jah has already come, and they did not know
him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of man will
suffer at their hands."
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John
the Baptist.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and kneeling

"17" = ''':sup:`17` And Jesus answered, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long

"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we
not cast it out?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He said to them, "Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to
you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this
mountain, `Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will
be impossible to you."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of
man is to be delivered into the hands of men,

"23" = ''':sup:`23` and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day."
And they were greatly distressed.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` When they came to Caper'na-um, the collectors of the half-shekel
tax went up to Peter and said, "Does not your teacher pay the tax?"
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He said, "Yes." And when he came home, Jesus spoke to him first,
saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take
toll or tribute? From their sons or from others?"
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And when he said, "From others," Jesus said to him, "Then the sons
are free.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a
hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its
mouth you will find a shekel; take that and give it to them for me and
for yourself."
