"1" = ''':sup:`1` Great are thy judgments and hard to describe; therefore unintructed
souls have gone astray.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` For when lawless men supposed that they held the holy nation in
their power, they themselves lay as captives of darkness and prisoners
of long night, shut in under their roofs, exiles from eternal
providence.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` For thinking that in their secret sins they were unobserved behind a
dark curtain of forgetfulness, they were scattered, terribly alarmed,
and appalled by specters.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` For not even the inner chamber that held them protected them from
fear, but terrifying sounds rang out around them, and dismal phantoms
with gloomy faces appeared.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And no power of fire was able to give light, nor did the brilliant
flames of the stars avail to illumine that hateful night.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Nothing was shining through to them except a dreadful, self-kindled
fire, and in terror they deemed the things which they saw to be worse
than that unseen appearance.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` The delusions of their magic art lay humbled, and their boasted
wisdom was scornfully rebuked.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` For those who promised to drive off the fears and disorders of a
sick soul were sick themselves with ridiculous fear.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For even if nothing disturbing frightened them, yet, scared by the
passing of beasts and the hissing of serpents,
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` they perished in trembling fear, refusing to look even at the air,
though it nowhere could be avoided.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For wickedness is a cowardly thing, condemned by its own testimony;
distressed by conscience, it has always exaggerated the difficulties.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` For fear is nothing but surrender of the helps that come from
reason;
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` and the inner expectation of help, being weak, prefers ignorance of
what causes the torment.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But throughout the night, which was really powerless, and which
beset them from the recesses of powerless Hades, they all slept the
same sleep,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` and now were driven by monstrous specters, and now were paralyzed
by their souls' surrender, for sudden and unexpected fear overwhelmed
them.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And whoever was there fell down, and thus was kept shut up in a
prison not made of iron;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` for whether he was a farmer or a shepherd or a workman who toiled
in the wilderness, he was seized, and endured the inescapable fate; for
with one chain of darkness they all were bound.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Whether there came a whistling wind, or a melodious sound of birds
in wide-spreading branches, or the rhythm of violently rushing water,
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` or the harsh crash of rocks hurled down, or the unseen running of
leaping animals, or the sound of the most savage roaring beasts, or an
echo thrown back from a hollow of the mountains, it paralyzed them with
terror.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For the whole world was illumined with brilliant light, and was
engaged in unhindered work,
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` while over those men alone heavy night was spread, an image of the
darkness that was destined to receive them; but still heavier than
darkness were they to themselves.
