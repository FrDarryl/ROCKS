"1" = ''':sup:`1` But Judas, who was also called Maccabeus, and his companions
secretly entered the villages and summoned their kinsmen and enlisted
those who had continued in the Jewish faith, and so they gathered about
six thousand men.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` They besought the Lord to look upon the people who were oppressed by
all, and to have pity on the temple which had been profaned by ungodly
men,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` and to have mercy on the city which was being destroyed and about to
be leveled to the ground, and to hearken to the blood that cried out to
him,
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` and to remember also the lawless destruction of the innocent babies
and the blasphemies committed against his name, and to show his hatred
of evil.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` As soon as Maccabeus got his army organized, the Gentiles could not
withstand him, for the wrath of the Lord had turned to mercy.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Coming without warning, he would set fire to towns and villages. He
captured strategic positions and put to flight not a few of the enemy.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` He found the nights most advantageous for such attacks. And talk of
his valor spread everywhere.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` When Philip saw that the man was gaining ground little by little,
and that he was pushing ahead with more frequent successes, he wrote to
Ptolemy, the governor of Coelesyria and Phoenicia, for aid to the
king's government.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And Ptolemy promptly appointed Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one of
the king's chief friends, and sent him, in command of no fewer than
twenty thousand Gentiles of all nations, to wipe out the whole race of
Judea. He associated with him Gorgias, a general and a man of
experience in military service.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Nicanor determined to make up for the king the tribute due to the
Romans, two thousand talents, by selling the captured Jews into
slavery.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And he immediately sent to the cities on the seacoast, inviting
them to buy Jewish slaves and promising to hand over ninety slaves for
a talent, not expecting the judgment from the Almighty that was about
to overtake him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Word came to Judas concerning Nicanor's invasion; and when he told
his companions of the arrival of the army,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` those who were cowardly and distrustful of God's justice ran off
and got away.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` Others sold all their remaining property, and at the same time
besought the Lord to rescue those who had been sold by the ungodly
Nicanor before he ever met them,
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` if not for their own sake, yet for the sake of the covenants made
with their fathers, and because he had called them by his holy and
glorious name.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But Maccabeus gathered his men together, to the number six
thousand, and exhorted them not to be frightened by the enemy and not
to fear the great multitude of Gentiles who were wickedly coming
against them, but to fight nobly,
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` keeping before their eyes the lawless outrage which the Gentiles
had committed against the holy place, and the torture of the derided
city, and besides, the overthrow of their ancestral way of life.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "For they trust to arms and acts of daring," he said, "but we trust
in the Almighty God, who is able with a single nod to strike down those
who are coming against us and even the whole world."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Moreover, he told them of the times when help came to their
ancestors; both the time of Sennacherib, when one hundred and
eighty-five thousand perished,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` and the time of the battle with the Galatians that took place in
Babylonia, when eight thousand in all went into the affair, with four
thousand Macedonians; and when the Macedonians were hard pressed, the
eight thousand, by the help that came to them from heaven, destroyed
one hundred and twenty thousand and took much booty.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` With these words he filled them with good courage and made them
ready to die for their laws and their country; then he divided his army
into four parts.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` He appointed his brothers also, Simon and Joseph and Jonathan, each
to command a division, putting fifteen hundred men under each.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` Besides, he appointed Eleazar to read aloud from the holy book, and
gave the watchword, "God's help"; then, leading the first division
himself, he joined battle with Nicanor.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` With the Almighty as their ally, they slew more than nine thousand
of the enemy, and wounded and disabled most of Nicanor's army, and
forced them all to flee.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` They captured the money of those who had come to buy them as
slaves. After pursuing them for some distance, they were obliged to
return because the hour was late.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For it was the day before the sabbath, and for that reason they did
not continue their pursuit.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And when they had collected the arms of the enemy and stripped them
of their spoils, they kept the sabbath, giving great praise and thanks
to the Lord, who had preserved them for that day and allotted it to
them as the beginning of mercy.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` After the sabbath they gave some of the spoils to those who had
been tortured and to the widows and orphans, and distributed the rest
among themselves and their children.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` When they had done this, they made common supplication and besought
the merciful Lord to be wholly reconciled with his servants.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` In encounters with the forces of Timothy and Bacchides they killed
more than twenty thousand of them and got possession of some
exceedingly high strongholds, and they divided very much plunder,
giving to those who had been tortured and to the orphans and widows,
and also to the aged, shares equal to their own.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Collecting the arms of the enemy, they stored them all carefully in
strategic places, and carried the rest of the spoils to Jerusalem.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` They killed the commander of Timothy's forces, a most unholy man,
and one who had greatly troubled the Jews.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` While they were celebrating the victory in the city of their
fathers, they burned those who had set fire to the sacred gates,
Callisthenes and some others, who had fled into one little house; so
these received the proper recompense for their impiety.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` The thrice-accursed Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants
to buy the Jews,
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` having been humbled with the help of the Lord by opponents whom he
regarded as of the least account, took off his splendid uniform and
made his way alone like a runaway slave across the country till he
reached Antioch, having succeeded chiefly in the destruction of his own
army!
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Thus he who had undertaken to secure tribute for the Romans by the
capture of the people of Jerusalem proclaimed that the Jews had a
Defender, and that therefore the Jews were invulnerable, because they
followed the laws ordained by him.
