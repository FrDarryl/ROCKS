"1" = ''':sup:`1` King Nebuchadnez'zar to all peoples, nations, and languages, that
dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you!
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most
High God has wrought toward me.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an
everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` I, Nebuchadnez'zar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my
palace.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` I had a dream which made me afraid; as I lay in bed the fancies and
the visions of my head alarmed me.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Therefore I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be
brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation
of the dream.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chalde'ans, and the
astrologers came in; and I told them the dream, but they could not make
known to me its interpretation.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` At last Daniel came in before me -- he who was named Belteshaz'zar
after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods --
and I told him the dream, saying,
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` "O Belteshaz'zar, chief of the magicians, because I know that the
spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is difficult for
you, here is the dream which I saw; tell me its interpretation.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` The visions of my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw, and
behold, a tree in the midst of the earth; and its height was great.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and
it was visible to the end of the whole earth.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Its leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for
all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the
air dwelt in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` "I saw in the visions of my head as I lay in bed, and behold, a
watcher, a holy one, came down from heaven.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` He cried aloud and said thus, `Hew down the tree and cut off its
branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit; let the beasts
flee from under it and the birds from its branches.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of
iron and bronze, amid the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet
with the dew of heaven; let his lot be with the beasts in the grass of
the earth;
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` let his mind be changed from a man's, and let a beast's mind be
given to him; and let seven times pass over him.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the
word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the
Most High rules the kingdom of men, and gives it to whom he will, and
sets over it the lowliest of men.'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` This dream I, King Nebuchadnez'zar, saw. And you, O Belteshaz'zar,
declare the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are
not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you are able, for
the spirit of the holy gods is in you."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshaz'zar, was dismayed for a
moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, "Belteshaz'zar,
let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you." Belteshaz'zar
answered, "My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its
interpretation for your enemies!
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` The tree you saw, which grew and became strong, so that its top
reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` whose leaves were fair and its fruit abundant, and in which was
food for all; under which beasts of the field found shade, and in whose
branches the birds of the air dwelt --
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong. Your greatness
has grown and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the ends of the
earth.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And whereas the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from
heaven and saying, `Hew down the tree and destroy it, but leave the
stump of its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze,
in the tender grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of
heaven; and let his lot be with the beasts of the field, till seven
times pass over him';
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` this is the interpretation, O king: It is a decree of the Most
High, which has come upon my lord the king,
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` that you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be
with the beasts of the field; you shall be made to eat grass like an
ox, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall
pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules the kingdom of
men, and gives it to whom he will.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And as it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the
tree, your kingdom shall be sure for you from the time that you know
that Heaven rules.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you; break off
your sins by practicing righteousness, and your iniquities by showing
mercy to the oppressed, that there may perhaps be a lengthening of your
tranquillity."
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` All this came upon King Nebuchadnez'zar.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal
palace of Babylon,
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` and the king said, "Is not this great Babylon, which I have built
by my mighty power as a royal residence and for the glory of my
majesty?"
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` While the words were still in the king's mouth, there fell a voice
from heaven, "O King Nebuchadnez'zar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom
has departed from you,
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` and you shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be
with the beasts of the field; and you shall be made to eat grass like
an ox; and seven times shall pass over you, until you have learned that
the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Immediately the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnez'zar. He was
driven from among men, and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet
with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles' feathers,
and his nails were like birds' claws.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnez'zar, lifted my eyes to
heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and
praised and honored him who lives for ever; for his dominion is an
everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to
generation;
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing; and he
does according to his will in the host of heaven and among the
inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him,
"What doest thou?"
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my
kingdom, my majesty and splendor returned to me. My counselors and my
lords sought me, and I was established in my kingdom, and still more
greatness was added to me.
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` Now I, Nebuchadnez'zar, praise and extol and honor the King of
heaven; for all his works are right and his ways are just; and those
who walk in pride he is able to abase.

4:1-3 - Nebuchadnezzar begins with a decree praising God for His
sovereignty. This recognition of divine power becomes a central theme,
but it will be challenged by Nebuchadnezzar's own experience (see also
4:4-18 - The king has a dream about a great tree being cut down, and
Daniel is called to interpret it. The dream prophesies the temporary
downfall of Nebuchadnezzar, who will be humbled for his pride and left
to live like an animal until he acknowledges God's sovereignty (see
4:19-27 - Daniel interprets the dream and advises the king to repent to
avoid divine judgment. This passage highlights human pride and the need
for humility before God, who alone is sovereign over all the kingdoms
4:28-33 - The fulfillment of Daniel's prophecy occurs when
Nebuchadnezzar is temporarily removed from his position, living like an
animal until he acknowledges God's sovereignty. This event serves as a
warning against human pride and self-sufficiency (see also
4:34-37 - Nebuchadnezzar repents and praises God for His sovereignty.
His restoration is a lesson in the importance of recognizing God's
dominion over history and governments. Nebuchadnezzar's humiliation is
