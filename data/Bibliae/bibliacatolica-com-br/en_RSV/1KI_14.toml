"4" = ''':sup:`4` Jerobo'am's wife did so; she arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to
the house of Ahi'jah. Now Ahi'jah could not see, for his eyes were dim
because of his age.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And the LORD said to Ahi'jah, "Behold, the wife of Jerobo'am is
coming to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick. Thus and
thus shall you say to her." When she came, she pretended to be another

"6" = ''':sup:`6` But when Ahi'jah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the

word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahi'jah the prophet.

reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the
Kings of Israel.

forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen
years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the
tribes of Israel, to put his name there. His mother's name was Na'amah
the Ammonitess.

provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, more
than all that their fathers had done.

Ashe'rim on every high hill and under every green tree;
