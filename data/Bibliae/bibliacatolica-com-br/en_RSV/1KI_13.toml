"1" = ''':sup:`1` And behold, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the LORD
to Bethel. Jerobo'am was standing by the altar to burn incense.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And the man cried against the altar by the word of the LORD, and
said, "O altar, altar, thus says the LORD: `Behold, a son shall be born
to the house of David, Josi'ah by name; and he shall sacrifice upon you
the priests of the high places who burn incense upon you, and men's
bones shall be burned upon you.'"
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And he gave a sign the same day, saying, "This is the sign that the
LORD has spoken: `Behold, the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes
that are upon it shall be poured out.'"
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried
against the altar at Bethel, Jerobo'am stretched out his hand from the
altar, saying, "Lay hold of him." And his hand, which he stretched out
against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the
altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word
of the LORD.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And the king said to the man of God, "Entreat now the favor of the
LORD your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me."
And the man of God entreated the LORD; and the king's hand was restored
to him, and became as it was before.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And the king said to the man of God, "Come home with me, and refresh
yourself, and I will give you a reward."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And the man of God said to the king, "If you give me half your
house, I will not go in with you. And I will not eat bread or drink
water in this place;
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` for so was it commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, `You
shall neither eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way that
you came.'"
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` So he went another way, and did not return by the way that he came
to Bethel.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel. And his sons came and
told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; the words
also which he had spoken to the king, they told to their father.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And their father said to them, "Which way did he go?" And his sons
showed him the way which the man of God who came from Judah had gone.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And he said to his sons, "Saddle the ass for me." So they saddled
the ass for him and he mounted it.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And he went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an
oak; and he said to him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?"
And he said, "I am."
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then he said to him, "Come home with me and eat bread."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And he said, "I may not return with you, or go in with you; neither
will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place;
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` for it was said to me by the word of the LORD, `You shall neither
eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.'"
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And he said to him, "I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel
spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, `Bring him back with you
into your house that he may eat bread and drink water.'" But he lied to
him.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` So he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and drank
water.
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` And as they sat at the table, the word of the LORD came to the
prophet who had brought him back;
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` and he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, "Thus says the
LORD, `Because you have disobeyed the word of the LORD, and have not
kept the commandment which the LORD your God commanded you,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` but have come back, and have eaten bread and drunk water in the
place of which he said to you, "Eat no bread, and drink no water"; your
body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.'"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the ass for the
prophet whom he had brought back.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And as he went away a lion met him on the road and killed him. And
his body was thrown in the road, and the ass stood beside it; the lion
also stood beside the body.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` And behold, men passed by, and saw the body thrown in the road, and
the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city
where the old prophet dwelt.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of
it, he said, "It is the man of God, who disobeyed the word of the LORD;
therefore the LORD has given him to the lion, which has torn him and
slain him, according to the word which the LORD spoke to him."
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And he said to his sons, "Saddle the ass for me." And they saddled
it.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` And he went and found his body thrown in the road, and the ass and
the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or
torn the ass.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it upon
the ass, and brought it back to the city, to mourn and to bury him.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And he laid the body in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
saying, "Alas, my brother!"
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And after he had buried him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury
me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside
his bones.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the
altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which
are in the cities of Sama'ria, shall surely come to pass."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` After this thing Jerobo'am did not turn from his evil way, but made
priests for the high places again from among all the people; any who
would, he consecrated to be priests of the high places.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And this thing became sin to the house of Jerobo'am, so as to cut
it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth.
