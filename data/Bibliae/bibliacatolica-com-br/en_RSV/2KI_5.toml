"1" = ''':sup:`1` Na'aman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man
with his master and in high favor, because by him the LORD had given
victory to Syria. He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off a little maid
from the land of Israel, and she waited on Na'aman's wife.
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` She said to her mistress, "Would that my lord were with the prophet
who is in Sama'ria! He would cure him of his leprosy."
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` So Na'aman went in and told his lord, "Thus and so spoke the maiden
from the land of Israel."
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` And the king of Syria said, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the
king of Israel." So he went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six
thousand shekels of gold, and ten festal garments.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, "When
this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you Na'aman my
servant, that you may cure him of his leprosy."
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` And when the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and
said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to
me to cure a man of his leprosy? Only consider, and see how he is
seeking a quarrel with me."
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` But when Eli'sha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had
rent his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, "Why have you rent your
clothes? Let him come now to me, that he may know that there is a
prophet in Israel."
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` So Na'aman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the door
of Eli'sha's house.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And Eli'sha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the
Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be
clean."
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` But Na'aman was angry, and went away, saying, "Behold, I thought
that he would surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of
the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Are not Aba'na and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all
the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?" So he
turned and went away in a rage.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But his servants came near and said to him, "My father, if the
prophet had commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have
done it? How much rather, then, when he says to you, `Wash, and be
clean'?"
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan,
according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored
like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and he
came and stood before him; and he said, "Behold, I know that there is
no God in all the earth but in Israel; so accept now a present from
your servant."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But he said, "As the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will receive
none." And he urged him to take it, but he refused.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Then Na'aman said, "If not, I pray you, let there be given to your
servant two mules' burden of earth; for henceforth your servant will
not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the LORD.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master
goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, leaning on my arm, and
I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of
Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this matter."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` He said to him, "Go in peace." But when Na'aman had gone from him a
short distance,
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Geha'zi, the servant of Eli'sha the man of God, said, "See, my
master has spared this Na'aman the Syrian, in not accepting from his
hand what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him, and get
something from him."
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` So Geha'zi followed Na'aman. And when Na'aman saw some one running
after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, "Is all
well?"
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And he said, "All is well. My master has sent me to say, `There
have just now come to me from the hill country of E'phraim two young
men of the sons of the prophets; pray, give them a talent of silver and
two festal garments.'"
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And Na'aman said, "Be pleased to accept two talents." And he urged
him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two festal
garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they carried them
before Geha'zi.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and put
them in the house; and he sent the men away, and they departed.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` He went in, and stood before his master, and Eli'sha said to him,
"Where have you been, Geha'zi?" And he said, "Your servant went
nowhere."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` But he said to him, "Did I not go with you in spirit when the man
turned from his chariot to meet you? Was it a time to accept money and
garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and
maidservants?
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Therefore the leprosy of Na'aman shall cleave to you, and to your
descendants for ever." So he went out from his presence a leper, as
white as snow.
