this sickness."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` But the angel of the LORD said to Eli'jah the Tishbite, "Arise, go
up to meet the messengers of the king of Sama'ria, and say to them, `Is
it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of
Ba'al-ze'bub, the god of Ekron?'

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And they said to him, "There came a man to meet us, and said to us,
`Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the LORD,
Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire
of Ba'al-ze'bub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down
from the bed to which you have gone, but shall surely die.'"

"7" = ''':sup:`7` He said to them, "What kind of man was he who came to meet you and
told you these things?"

"9" = ''':sup:`9` Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He

"13" = ''':sup:`13` Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty.
And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees

life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in
your sight.

"14" = ''':sup:`14` Lo, fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two former

you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone, but you
shall surely die.'"
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` So he died according to the word of the LORD which Eli'jah had
