taken; the fortress is put to shame and broken down;

"2" = ''':sup:`2` the renown of Moab is no more. In Heshbon they planned evil against

of Horona'im they have heard the cry of destruction.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` Flee! Save yourselves! Be like a wild ass in the desert!
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For, because you trusted in your strongholds and your treasures, you
also shall be taken; and Chemosh shall go forth into exile, with his
priests and his princes.
'''

the valley shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD
has spoken.

a desolation, with no inhabitant in them.

cursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` "Moab has been at ease from his youth and has settled on his lees;
he has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into
exile; so his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` "Therefore, behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I
shall send to him tilters who will tilt him, and empty his vessels, and
break his jars in pieces.

ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.

apace.

name; say, `How the mighty scepter is broken, the glorious staff.'
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` "Come down from your glory, and sit on the parched ground, O
inhabitant of Dibon! For the destroyer of Moab has come up against you;
he has destroyed your strongholds.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Stand by the way and watch, O inhabitant of Aro'er! Ask him who
flees and her who escapes; say, `What has happened?'
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` Moab is put to shame, for it is broken; wail and cry! Tell it by
the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` "Judgment has come upon the tableland, upon Holon, and Jahzah, and
Meph'a-ath,
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` and Dibon, and Nebo, and Beth-diblatha'im,
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` and Kiriatha'im, and Beth-ga'mul, and Beth-me'on,

far and near.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says the LORD.

that Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he too shall be held in
derision.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` Was not Israel a derision to you? Was he found among thieves, that
whenever you spoke of him you wagged your head?
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` "Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, O inhabitants of Moab! Be
like the dove that nests in the sides of the mouth of a gorge.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` We have heard of the pride of Moab -- he is very proud -- of his
loftiness, his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his
heart.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` I know his insolence, says the LORD; his boasts are false, his
deeds are false.
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Therefore I wail for Moab; I cry out for all Moab; for the men of
Kir-he'res I mourn.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` More than for Jazer I weep for you, O vine of Sibmah! Your branches
passed over the sea, reached as far as Jazer; upon your summer fruits
and your vintage the destroyer has fallen.
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` Gladness and joy have been taken away from the fruitful land of
Moab; I have made the wine cease from the wine presses; no one treads
them with shouts of joy; the shouting is not the shout of joy.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` "Heshbon and Ele-a'leh cry out; as far as Jahaz they utter their
voice, from Zo'ar to Horona'im and Eg'lath-shelish'iyah. For the waters
of Nimrim also have become desolate.
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And I will bring to an end in Moab, says the LORD, him who offers
sacrifice in the high place and burns incense to his god.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a flute, and my heart moans
like a flute for the men of Kir-he'res; therefore the riches they
gained have perished.

hands are gashes, and on the loins is sackcloth.
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` On all the housetops of Moab and in the squares there is nothing
but lamentation; for I have broken Moab like a vessel for which no one
cares, says the LORD.
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` How it is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in
shame! So Moab has become a derision and a horror to all that are round
about him."
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` For thus says the LORD: "Behold, one shall fly swiftly like an
eagle, and spread his wings against Moab;
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` the cities shall be taken and the strongholds seized. The heart of
the warriors of Moab shall be in that day like the heart of a woman in
her pangs;
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Moab shall be destroyed and be no longer a people, because he
magnified himself against the LORD.
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` Terror, pit, and snare are before you, O inhabitant of Moab! says
the LORD.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` He who flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and he who
climbs out of the pit shall be caught in the snare. For I will bring
these things upon Moab in the year of their punishment, says the LORD.
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` "In the shadow of Heshbon fugitives stop without strength; for a
fire has gone forth from Heshbon, a flame from the house of Sihon; it
has destroyed the forehead of Moab, the crown of the sons of tumult.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh is undone; for your sons
have been taken captive, and your daughters into captivity.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days, says
the LORD." Thus far is the judgment on Moab.
