"1" = ''':sup:`1` It was now two days before the Passover and the feast of Unleavened
Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest
him by stealth, and kill him;
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` for they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be a tumult of the
people."
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he
sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure
nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, "Why was the
ointment thus wasted?
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred
denarii, and given to the poor." And they reproached her.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But Jesus said, "Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has done
a beautiful thing to me.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you will, you
can do good to them; but you will not always have me.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for
burying.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the
whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her."
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief
priests in order to betray him to them.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` And when they heard it they were glad, and promised to give him
money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the
passover lamb, his disciples said to him, "Where will you have us go
and prepare for you to eat the passover?"
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, "Go into the
city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him,
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` and wherever he enters, say to the householder, `The Teacher says,
Where is my guest room, where I am to eat the passover with my
disciples?'
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there
prepare for us."
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` And the disciples set out and went to the city, and found it as he
had told them; and they prepared the passover.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` And when it was evening he came with the twelve.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` And as they were at table eating, Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you,
one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me."
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one after another,
"Is it I?"
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` He said to them, "It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread
into the dish with me.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` For the Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that
man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better for
that man if he had not been born."
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` And as they were eating, he took bread, and blessed, and broke it,
and gave it to them, and said, "Take; this is my body."
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them,
and they all drank of it.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And he said to them, "This is my blood of the covenant, which is
poured out for many.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the
vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of
Olives.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away; for it is written,
`I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee."
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Peter said to him, "Even though they all fall away, I will not."
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And Jesus said to him, "Truly, I say to you, this very night,
before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times."
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` But he said vehemently, "If I must die with you, I will not deny
you." And they all said the same.
'''
"32" = ''':sup:`32` And they went to a place which was called Gethsem'ane; and he said
to his disciples, "Sit here, while I pray."
'''
"33" = ''':sup:`33` And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be
greatly distressed and troubled.
'''
"34" = ''':sup:`34` And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death;
remain here, and watch."
'''
"35" = ''':sup:`35` And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that,
if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
'''
"36" = ''':sup:`36` And he said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove
this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt."
'''
"37" = ''':sup:`37` And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "Simon,
are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?
'''
"38" = ''':sup:`38` Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit
indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
'''
"39" = ''':sup:`39` And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.
'''
"40" = ''':sup:`40` And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very
heavy; and they did not know what to answer him.
'''
"41" = ''':sup:`41` And he came the third time, and said to them, "Are you still
sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come; the Son
of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
'''
"42" = ''':sup:`42` Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."
'''
"43" = ''':sup:`43` And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of
the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief
priests and the scribes and the elders.
'''
"44" = ''':sup:`44` Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I shall
kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard."
'''
"45" = ''':sup:`45` And when he came, he went up to him at once, and said, "Master!"
And he kissed him.
'''
"46" = ''':sup:`46` And they laid hands on him and seized him.
'''
"47" = ''':sup:`47` But one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave
of the high priest and cut off his ear.
'''
"48" = ''':sup:`48` And Jesus said to them, "Have you come out as against a robber,
with swords and clubs to capture me?
'''
"49" = ''':sup:`49` Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did
not seize me. But let the scriptures be fulfilled."
'''
"50" = ''':sup:`50` And they all forsook him, and fled.
'''
"51" = ''':sup:`51` And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about
his body; and they seized him,
'''
"52" = ''':sup:`52` but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked.
'''
"53" = ''':sup:`53` And they led Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests
and the elders and the scribes were assembled.
'''
"54" = ''':sup:`54` And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard
of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, and warming
himself at the fire.
'''
"55" = ''':sup:`55` Now the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony
against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.
'''
"56" = ''':sup:`56` For many bore false witness against him, and their witness did not
agree.
'''
"57" = ''':sup:`57` And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,
'''
"58" = ''':sup:`58` "We heard him say, `I will destroy this temple that is made with
hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.'"
'''
"59" = ''':sup:`59` Yet not even so did their testimony agree.
'''
"60" = ''':sup:`60` And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, "Have
you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"
'''
"61" = ''':sup:`61` But he was silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked
him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
'''
"62" = ''':sup:`62` And Jesus said, "I am; and you will see the Son of man seated at
the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."
'''
"63" = ''':sup:`63` And the high priest tore his garments, and said, "Why do we still
need witnesses?
'''
"64" = ''':sup:`64` You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?" And they all
condemned him as deserving death.
'''
"65" = ''':sup:`65` And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike
him, saying to him, "Prophesy!" And the guards received him with blows.
'''
"66" = ''':sup:`66` And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the
high priest came;
'''
"67" = ''':sup:`67` and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "You
also were with the Nazarene, Jesus."
'''
"68" = ''':sup:`68` But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you
mean." And he went out into the gateway.
'''
"69" = ''':sup:`69` And the maid saw him, and began again to say to the bystanders,
"This man is one of them."
'''
"70" = ''':sup:`70` But again he denied it. And after a little while again the
bystanders said to Peter, "Certainly you are one of them; for you are a
Galilean."
'''
"71" = ''':sup:`71` But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not
know this man of whom you speak."
'''
"72" = ''':sup:`72` And immediately the cock crowed a second time. And Peter remembered
how Jesus had said to him, "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny
me three times." And he broke down and wept.

Notas de rodap√©:
14:1-2 - The religious leaders plan to forcibly arrest Jesus during the
Passover festival, highlighting their opposition to the Messiah. This
highlights the reality of the suffering and rejection Jesus would face

extravagant devotion and profound adoration. This act anticipates
Christ's sacrifice, expressing recognition of His royalty and proximity

showing that even those closest to Him can fail. This prediction of
Judas' betrayal underscores the nature of Christ's sacrifice and the

14:22-25 - Jesus institutes the Last Supper, giving new meaning to
Passover by associating His body and blood with the bread and wine. The
