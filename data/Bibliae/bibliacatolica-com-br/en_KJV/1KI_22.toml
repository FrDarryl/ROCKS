Notas de rodap√©:
22:5-9 - Before going to war against Ramoth-gilead, Jehoshaphat, king
of Judah, asks Ahab to inquire of the word of the Lord. Micaiah, the
true prophet of God, is called, highlighting the importance of seeking
divine guidance before making significant decisions (see also
22:15-18 - Micaiah prophesies Israel's defeat, but Ahab rejects his
message and chooses to follow false prophets. This demonstrates how
refusing to listen to God's truth can lead to destruction (see also
22:19-23 - Micaiah reveals the vision of the heavenly council, where a
lying spirit is sent to deceive Ahab. This vision illustrates God's
sovereign control over all events and God's permissiveness in the face
Thessalonians 2:11-12).
22:29-34 - Despite his precautions, Ahab is mortally wounded in battle,
fulfilling Micaiah's prophecy. This shows that human plans cannot
thwart God's purposes, and God's word always comes true (see also
22:37-40 - Ahab's death and the judgment upon his house are fulfilled
according to the word of the Lord. His reign is marked by idolatry and
disobedience, and his death brings to mind the consequences of sin (see
