"1" = ''':sup:`1` Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came
to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath
days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
'''
"3" = ''':sup:`3` Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and
risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you,
is Christ.
'''
"4" = ''':sup:`4` And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of
the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them
certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set
all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought
to bring them out to the people.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren
unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world
upside down are come hither also;
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they
heard these things.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they
let them go.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto

"11" = ''':sup:`11` These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
'''
"12" = ''':sup:`12` Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which
were Greeks, and of men, not a few.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of
God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred
up the people.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were
to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving
a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all
speed, they departed.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in
him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the
devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,
encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some,
He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached
unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we

"20" = ''':sup:`20` For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know
therefore what these things mean.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their
time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)
Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar
with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly
worship, him declare I unto you.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is
Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any
thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all
the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed,
and the bounds of their habitation;
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him,
and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also
of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven
by art and man's device.
'''
"30" = ''':sup:`30` And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth
all men every where to repent:
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the
the dead.

"32" = ''':sup:`32` And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked:

"33" = ''':sup:`33` So Paul departed from among them.

Notas de rodap√©:
17:2-3 - Paul, as he had often done, began preaching in the synagogues,
explaining the Scriptures and showing that the Messiah would have to
suffer. Paul's preaching emphasized the need to understand the
Scriptures in order to understand the plan of salvation (see also
17:22-23 - Paul addresses the Athenians, presenting the "unknown God"
as the true God, emphasizing that He does not dwell in temples made by
human hands. This discourse highlights the contrast between traditional
17:30-31 - Paul calls the Athenians to repentance, for God has
appointed a day of judgment. Jesus' resurrection is the foundation of
Corinthians 5:10).
17:34 - Some Athenians were converted to the gospel after hearing Paul,
reflecting the power of Christ's message to reach prepared hearts. The
conversion of Dionysius and Damaris is an example of God's grace in
