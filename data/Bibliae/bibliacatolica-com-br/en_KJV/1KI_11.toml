11:1-3 - Solomon disobeyed God by marrying numerous foreign women, who
ultimately turned his heart to other gods. His moral and spiritual
decline contrasted with the promising beginning of his reign and
demonstrated the danger of disobedience (see also Deuteronomy 7:3-4 and
11:4-6 - Solomon, now elderly, is led to worship other gods because of
his wives. His unfaithfulness to God marks the beginning of the
division of the kingdom of Israel. The impact of idolatry is profound,
even for a king so blessed with wisdom (see also Deuteronomy 17:17 and
11:9-13 - God is angry with Solomon for his straying and announces that

Kings 12:15).
11:14-22 - God raises adversaries against Solomon, including Hadad the
Edomite. This growing opposition reflects divine judgment on the king
who strayed from obedience. The consequences of Solomon's sin begin to
11:26-40 - Jeroboam, Solomon's servant, is chosen by God to rule the
ten tribes of Israel. The prophet Ahijah symbolizes this division by
tearing his cloak into twelve pieces. This event marks the beginning of
Israel's political and spiritual division (see also 1 Kings 12:20 and
