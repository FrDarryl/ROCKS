thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for
myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am
accused of the Jews:
questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me
patiently.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine
own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;

"5" = ''':sup:`5` Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after
the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of
God unto our fathers:
and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am
accused of the Jews.
'''
"8" = ''':sup:`8` Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
should raise the dead?
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I
shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests;
even unto strange cities.

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from
the chief priests,
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the
brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed
with me.
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking
unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest

"15" = ''':sup:`15` And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee
for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these
things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will
appear unto thee;
now I send thee,
forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by
faith that is in me.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.

"21" = ''':sup:`21` For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about

"22" = ''':sup:`22` Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those
which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and
to the Gentiles.
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,
Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
'''
"25" = ''':sup:`25` But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the
words of truth and soberness.
'''
"26" = ''':sup:`26` For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from
him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
'''
"27" = ''':sup:`27` King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest.
'''
"28" = ''':sup:`28` Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian.
'''
"29" = ''':sup:`29` And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all
that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am,
except these bonds.

"30" = ''':sup:`30` And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,
and Bernice, and they that sat with them:
'''
"31" = ''':sup:`31` And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.

liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
