temptation to trust in human strength rather than divine providence.
This act is considered sinful because it expresses self-sufficiency and
3:5-6).
21:7-8 - After taking the census, David acknowledges his sin and seeks
God's forgiveness. His willingness to admit his wrongdoing and repent
is an example of humility and submission to God's will (see also

21:26-27 - When David offers sacrifices, God responds by sending fire

18:38-39).
