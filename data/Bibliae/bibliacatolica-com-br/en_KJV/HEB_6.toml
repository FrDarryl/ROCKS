Notas de rodapé:
6:1-3 - The author exhorts Christians to advance toward spiritual
maturity by leaving behind elementary principles and seeking the full
knowledge of Christ. Maturity is necessary for a solid Christian life
6:4-6 - The author warns of the danger of apostasy, describing those
who fall away as those who reject God's grace after experiencing it.
6:9-12 - Despite the warning, the author expresses confidence in the
perseverance of his readers and exhorts them to imitate those who
through faith and patience inherit God’s promises (see also
6:13-20 - God's promise to Abraham is used as an example of a sure and
steadfast hope. The hope we have in Christ is an anchor for the soul,
1:2).
