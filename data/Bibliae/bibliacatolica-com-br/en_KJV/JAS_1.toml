"1" = ''':sup:`1` James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
'''
"2" = ''':sup:`2` My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
entire, wanting nothing.
'''
"5" = ''':sup:`5` If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
'''
"6" = ''':sup:`6` But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is
like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
'''
"7" = ''':sup:`7` For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the
Lord.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
'''
"10" = ''':sup:`10` But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the
grass he shall pass away.
'''
"11" = ''':sup:`11` For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of
the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in
his ways.
tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised
to them that love him.
'''
"13" = ''':sup:`13` Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God
cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
'''
"14" = ''':sup:`14` But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust,
and enticed.
'''
"15" = ''':sup:`15` Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when
it is finished, bringeth forth death.
'''
"16" = ''':sup:`16` Do not err, my beloved brethren.
'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither
shadow of turning.
'''
"18" = ''':sup:`18` Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
'''
"19" = ''':sup:`19` Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear,
slow to speak, slow to wrath:
'''
"20" = ''':sup:`20` For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
'''
"21" = ''':sup:`21` Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness,
and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save
your souls.
'''
"22" = ''':sup:`22` But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
own selves.
'''
"23" = ''':sup:`23` For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto
a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
'''
"24" = ''':sup:`24` For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
forgetteth what manner of man he was.

"25" = ''':sup:`25` But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth
this man shall be blessed in his deed.
