Notas de rodap√©:
6:1-2 - God's grace should not be used as an excuse for sin, because as
Christians, we have died to sin. Life transformation is evidenced by
6:3-4 - Baptism symbolizes union with Christ in His death and
resurrection, being an act of rebirth to a new life in Christ (see also
6:6-7 - The old human nature was crucified with Christ, so that we are
now freed from the dominion of sin. Justification brings the freedom to
4:22-24).
6:12-14 - The Christian must not allow sin to reign in his mortal body,
but instead offer himself to God as an instrument of righteousness.
Corinthians 6:19-20).
06:23 - The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life
in Christ Jesus. This verse is a crucial contrast between the fate of
3:16).
