world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to
them that love him?

you before the judgment seats?

of the law as transgressors.

"10" = ''':sup:`10` For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one

"11" = ''':sup:`11` For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a
transgressor of the law.

mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

'''
"17" = ''':sup:`17` Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.

through works. Faith without works is empty, and good works are the
3:18).
2:21-26 - James illustrates the relationship between faith and works
with the examples of Abraham and Rahab. Both demonstrated their faith
through bold and obedient actions toward God, reinforcing the truth
