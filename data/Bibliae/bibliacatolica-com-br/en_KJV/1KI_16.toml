Notas de rodap√©:
16:1-4 - The prophet Jehu announces the destruction of the house of
Baasha, king of Israel, because of their sins. The cycle of idolatry
and judgment continues, highlighting God's holiness and righteousness
(see also 1 Kings 15:29-30 and 2 Kings 9:7-10).
16:8-10 - Zimri conspires against Elah, Baasha's son, and kills him,
fulfilling the prophecy of judgment on the house of Baasha. The
violence and political instability in Israel reflect the turning away
16:11-14 - Zimri exterminates Baasha's entire family, fulfilling God's
word. However, Zimri's reign is brief, showing that rebellion against
God and the use of violence have consequences (see also 1 Kings
16:23-24 - Omri establishes Samaria as the new capital of Israel,
strengthening his political position. However, he continues in the sins
of Jeroboam, perpetuating the idolatry that separates the people from
16:29-33 - Ahab, son of Omri, becomes king and is described as the
worst king to date, for introducing the worship of Baal into Israel.
His union with Jezebel and the building of altars to Baal mark the
2:20).
