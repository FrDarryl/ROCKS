Notas de rodap√©:
6:1-2 - In the fourth year of his reign, Solomon began building the
Temple in Jerusalem. The fact that the Temple was built exactly 480
years after the Exodus from Egypt shows the importance of fulfilling
God's promises and establishing His presence among His people (see also
6:11-13 - God speaks to Solomon, assuring him that His presence will
dwell in the Temple if Israel follows His commandments. This emphasizes
that a relationship with God depends on obedience to His covenant, not
14:23).
6:14-18 - The Temple was completed with details of gold and cedar wood.
The beauty and richness of the materials symbolize God's glory and

6:19-22 - The Holy of Holies was overlaid with pure gold, emphasizing

placed. This represents God's closeness to His people, but also the
6:37-38 - The construction of the Temple took seven years to complete.
The number seven symbolizes perfection and completeness in the Bible,
indicating that the Temple was a perfect work, completed according to
