Notas de rodap√©:
7:1-2 - Solomon built his own palace, which took thirteen years to
complete. This contrasts sharply with the Temple, which took seven
years, indicating that Solomon's priority was serving God (see also
7:13-14 - Solomon called upon Hiram, a highly skilled craftsman, to
create the artistic details of the Temple. This shows that talented
human work, when dedicated to God, can be a means of glorifying Him
7:15-22 - The two bronze pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, were placed at
the entrance to the Temple. These pillars symbolize God's strength and
stability, sustaining His people and His plan of salvation (see also
7:23-26 - The Molten Sea, a large bronze basin, was made for the use of
the priests in the Temple. This reflects the importance of ritual
purity and sanctification before approaching God (see also
7:48-51 - All the Temple furnishings were finished and placed in the
sanctuary. The attention to detail in the objects of worship
demonstrates the reverence due to God and the importance of preparing
8:5).
