the root of immortality.

"4" = ''':sup:`4` For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us, nor an
image spotted with divers colours, the painter's fruitless labour;

"5" = ''':sup:`5` The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and so they
desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that
worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to have such

"7" = ''':sup:`7` For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vessel with
much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay he maketh both the
vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewise also all such as serve
to the contrary: but what is the use of either sort, the potter himself

"15" = ''':sup:`15` For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods: which
neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears
to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and as for their feet, they
