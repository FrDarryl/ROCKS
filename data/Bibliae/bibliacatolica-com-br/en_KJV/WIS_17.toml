scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, being horribly

"5" = ''':sup:`5` No power of the fire might give them light: neither could the bright
flames of the stars endure to lighten that horrible night.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, very
dreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the things which they
