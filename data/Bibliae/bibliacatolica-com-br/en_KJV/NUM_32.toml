Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the

over Jordan.

"6" = ''':sup:`6` And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

"7" = ''':sup:`7` And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from
going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?

"8" = ''':sup:`8` Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the
land.
'''
"9" = ''':sup:`9` For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should

"10" = ''':sup:`10` And the LORD'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
saying,

"11" = ''':sup:`11` Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years

Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:

"12" = ''':sup:`12` Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of
Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.

"13" = ''':sup:`13` And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them
wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that

"16" = ''':sup:`16` And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds
here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:

"17" = ''':sup:`17` But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel,
until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall
dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

"18" = ''':sup:`18` We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel
have inherited every man his inheritance.

"19" = ''':sup:`19` For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan

armed before the LORD to war,

hath driven out his enemies from before him,

return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this
land shall be your possession before the LORD.

Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

"26" = ''':sup:`26` Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall
be there in the cities of Gilead:

the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.

"28" = ''':sup:`28` So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of
Israel:

"29" = ''':sup:`29` And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children
of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle,
before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye
shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:

"30" = ''':sup:`30` But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
