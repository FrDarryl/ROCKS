Notas de rodap√©:
13:1-3 - Jehoahaz begins to reign over Israel, but he does what is evil
in the eyes of the Lord. Because of his idolatry, God allows Israel to
be oppressed by Hazael, king of Syria. This reflects God's justice in
13:4-6 - Jehoahaz seeks the Lord in his distress, and God sends a
deliverer to Israel. Even in the midst of idolatry, God shows mercy
107:19-20).
13:7-9 - Israel is severely weakened by its enemies, and the army is
reduced to a few troops. This weakening reflects the consequences of
rebellion against God and dependence on Him for victory (see also
Deuteronomy 28:25 and 2 Kings 17:20).
13:10-13 - Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, begins to reign in Israel.
Although he continues in the ways of his predecessors, doing what is
evil in the sight of the Lord, his history shows the continuing cycle
of sin and judgment in Israel (see also 1 Kings 16:2-3 and 2 Kings
14:24).
13:14-19 - The prophet Elisha, on his deathbed, prophesies Jehoash's
victory over the Syrians, but rebukes him for his lack of zeal. This
episode highlights the importance of faith and complete obedience in
4:17).
