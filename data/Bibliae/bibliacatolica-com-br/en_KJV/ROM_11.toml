11:1-6 - Paul affirms that God has not rejected Israel, for he himself,

Election by grace, not works, is the basis of salvation (see also 1
11:7-10 - Israel's unbelief does not hinder God's plan. He gave them a

11:11-15 - The fall of Israel resulted in the salvation of the

11:25-36 - Paul speaks of the mystery of Israel's salvation and how the

concludes with a hymn of praise to God's wisdom and sovereignty (see
