1:3-4 - Paul thanks God for the Thessalonians' faith and perseverance
amid persecution. Suffering is seen as an opportunity to grow
1:5-6 - Suffering and persecution serve as evidence of God's righteous
judgment, which rewards those who are faithful to Him. Tribulation also
1:7-10 - Jesus' coming is described as a judgment event, bringing
retribution for those who do not know God and for those who do not obey
the gospel. The promise of rest for Christians is central to this
1:11-12 - Paul prays that the Thessalonians will be worthy of God's
calling and will be strengthened in their faith. God's power will
sustain them and enable them to live in a way that glorifies the name
