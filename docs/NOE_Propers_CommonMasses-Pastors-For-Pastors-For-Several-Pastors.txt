Entrance Antiphon

I will appoint over you shepherds after my own heart,
who will shepherd you wisely and prudently (E.T. alleluia).
Priests of God, bless the Lord;
praise the Lord, all who are holy and humble of heart (E.T. alleluia).

Collect

O God, who to pasture your people
filled (the Bishops) blessed N. and N. with a spirit of truth and of
love,
grant that, as we celebrate their feast day with honor,
we may benefit by imitating them
and be given relief through their intercession.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

Prayer over the Offerings

We offer you a sacrifice of praise
in commemoration of your Saints, O Lord,
by which we trust to be delivered
from evils both present and to come.
Through Christ our Lord.

Communion Antiphon

The Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve,
and to give his life as a ransom for many (E.T. alleluia).

Prayer after Communion

We have received this heavenly Sacrament, O Lord,
as we commemorate your Saints N. and N.;
grant, we pray, that what we celebrate in time
we may attain with eternal joy.
Through Christ our Lord.
