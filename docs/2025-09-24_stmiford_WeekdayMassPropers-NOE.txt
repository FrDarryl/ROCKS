First Reading:
Isaiah 7:10-14; 8:10c
‘Behold, the virgin shall conceive.’
In those days: The Lord spoke to Ahaz: ‘Ask a sign of the Lord your
God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.’ But Ahaz said, ‘I will
not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test.’ And Isaiah said,
‘Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men,
that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a
sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call
his name Emmanuel — God is with us.’

Gospel Luke 1:26-38
‘Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son.’
At that time: The angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee
named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph,
of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to
her and said, ‘Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!’ But she was
greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of
greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid,
Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive
in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will
be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God
will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over
the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.’
And Mary said to the angel, ‘How will this be, since I am a virgin?’
And the angel answered her, ‘The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and
the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to
be born will be called holy — the Son of God. And behold, your relative
Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the
sixth month with her who was called barren. For nothing will be
impossible with God.’ And Mary said, ‘Behold, I am the servant of the
Lord; let it be to me according to your word.’ And the angel departed
from her.
