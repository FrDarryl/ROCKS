MASS PROPERS (NOE) for St Hilary, Bishop, Doctor with 'CommonMasses>Doctors'

Entrance Antiphon

In the midst of the Church he opened his mouth,
and the Lord filled him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding
and clothed him in a robe of glory (E.T. alleluia).
The mouth of the just man utters wisdom,
and his tongue tells forth what is just;
the law of his God is in his heart (E.T. alleluia).

Collect

Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that we may rightly understand and truthfully profess
the divinity of your Son,
which the Bishop Saint Hilary taught with such constancy.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

Prayer over the Offerings

May the sacrifice which we gladly present on the feast day of
blessed N.,
be pleasing to you, O God,
for, taught by him, we, too, give ourselves entirely to you in praise.
Through Christ our Lord.

Communion Antiphon

Behold a faithful and prudent steward
to give them their allowance of food at the proper time (E.T. alleluia).
He who ponders the law of the Lord day and night
will yield his fruit in due season (E.T. alleluia).

Prayer after Communion

Through Christ the teacher, O Lord,
instruct those you feed with Christ, the living Bread,
that on the feast day of blessed N. they may learn your truth
and express it in works of charity.
Through Christ our Lord.
